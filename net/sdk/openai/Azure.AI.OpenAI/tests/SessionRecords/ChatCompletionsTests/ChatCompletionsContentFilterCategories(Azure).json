              "content": "1. Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400\u00B0F (205\u00B0C). Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds and the stems. Lay the bell pepper halves on a baking sheet, cut side down. Bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until the skins are wrinkled and charred. Remove from oven and allow to cool before peeling off the skins.\n\n2. Grilling: Preheat grill to medium high heat. Cut the peppers into large flat pieces, removing the stems and seeds. Brush both sides of each piece with a little oil, grill for about 4-6 minutes on each side until charred and softened.\n\n3. Saut\u00E9ing: Cut bell pepper into strips or cubes. Heat some oil in a skillet over medium heat, add the diced or sliced bell pepper. Cook, stirring often, until tender and slightly caramelized, about 10 minutes.\n\n4. Steaming: Cut the top off the pepper and remove the seeds. Put the peppers in a steam basket in a pot with a tight fitting lid with an inch or two of water in the bottom. Steam until the peppers are tender (usually around 5-7 minutes).\n\n5. Stuffed Bell Peppers: Preheat your oven to 350\u00B0F (175\u00B0C). Cut off the tops of bell peppers, remove the seeds and the \u0022ribs\u0022 inside. Cook filling of choice (usually ground meat or vegetarian equivalent, rice, and seasonings), then stuff into the peppers. Place in a baking dish with a bit of water in the bottom. Cover with foil and bake for 25-30 minutes. Uncover and bake for additional 20-25 minutes.\n\n6. Eat it Raw: No cooking needed. You can simply wash, slice or dice the bell pepper and use it in salads or dips.\n\nRemember bell peppers come in various colors like red, yellow, green orange and each color has a slightly different taste from sweet to bit bitter. So don\u0027t be afraid to experiment and use different colors in your dishes."
