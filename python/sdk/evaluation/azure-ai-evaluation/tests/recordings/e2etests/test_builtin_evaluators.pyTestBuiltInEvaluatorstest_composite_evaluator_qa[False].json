It assesses the extent to which the answer directly and fully addresses the question without introducing unrelated or incorrect information. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating greater groundedness.\n\n# Ratings\n## [Groundedness: 1] (Completely Unrelated Response)\n**Definition:** An answer that does not relate to the question or the context in any way. It fails to address the topic, provides irrelevant information, or introduces completely unrelated subjects.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Context:** The company's annual meeting will be held next Thursday.\n  **Query:** When is the company's annual meeting?\n  **Response:** I enjoy hiking in the mountains during summer.\n\n  **Context:** The new policy aims to reduce carbon emissions by 20% over the next five years.\n  **Query:** What is the goal of the new policy?\n  **Response:** My favorite color is blue.\n\n## [Groundedness: 2] (Related Topic but Does Not Respond to the Query)\n**Definition:** An answer that relates to the general topic of the context but does not answer the specific question asked. It may mention concepts from the context but fails to provide a direct or relevant response.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Context:** The museum will exhibit modern art pieces from various local artists.\n  **Query:** What kind of art will be exhibited at the museum?\n  **Response:** Museums are important cultural institutions.\n\n  **Context:** The new software update improves battery life and performance.\n  **Query:** What does the new software update improve?\n  **Response:** Software updates can sometimes fix bugs.\n\n## [Groundedness: 3] (Attempts to Respond but Contains Incorrect Information)\n**Definition:** An answer that attempts to respond to the question but includes incorrect information not supported by the context. It may misstate facts, misinterpret the context, or provide erroneous details.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Context:** The festival starts on June 5th and features international musicians.\n  **Query:** When does the festival start?\n  **Response:** The festival starts on July 5th and features local artists.\n\n  **Context:** The recipe requires two eggs and one cup of milk.\n  **Query:** How many eggs are needed for the recipe?\n  **Response:** You need three eggs for the recipe.\n\n## [Groundedness: 4] (Partially Correct Response)\n**Definition:** An answer that provides a correct response to the question but is incomplete or lacks specific details mentioned in the context. It captures some of the necessary information but omits key elements needed for a full understanding.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Context:** The bookstore offers a 15% discount to students and a 10% discount to senior citizens.\n  **Query:** What discount does the bookstore offer to students?\n  **Response:** Students get a discount at the bookstore.\n\n  **Context:** The company's headquarters are located in Berlin, Germany.\n  **Query:** Where are the company's headquarters?\n  **Response:** The company's headquarters are in Germany.\n\n## [Groundedness: 5] (Fully Correct and Complete Response)\n**Definition:** An answer that thoroughly and accurately responds to the question, including all relevant details from the context. It directly addresses the question with precise information, demonstrating complete understanding without adding extraneous information.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Context:** The author released her latest novel, 'The Silent Echo', on September 1st.\n  **Query:** When was 'The Silent Echo' released?\n  **Response:** 'The Silent Echo' was released on September 1st.\n\n  **Context:** Participants must register by May 31st to be eligible for early bird pricing.\n  **Query:** By what date must participants register to receive early bird pricing?\n  **Response:** Participants must register by May 31st to receive early bird pricing.\n\n\n# Data\nCONTEXT: Tokyo is the capital of Japan.\nQUERY: Tokyo is the capital of which country?\nRESPONSE: Japan\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE in relation to the CONTEXT and QUERY based on the Definitions above. Your output should include the following information:\n- **ThoughtChain**: To improve the reasoning process, think step by step and include a step-by-step explanation of your thought process as you analyze the data based on the definitions. Keep it brief and start your ThoughtChain with \"Let's think step by step:\".\n- **Explanation**: a very short explanation of why you think the input Data should get that Score.\n- **Score**: based on your previous analysis, provide your Score. The Score you give MUST be a integer score (i.e., \"1\", \"2\"...) based on the levels of the definitions.\n\n\n## Please provide your answers between the tags: <S0>your chain of thoughts</S0>, <S1>your explanation</S1>, <S2>your Score</S2>.\n# Output"

Your task is to judge how relevant a RESPONSE is to a QUERY using the Relevance definitions provided.\n\nINPUT\n=====\nQUERY: Tokyo is the capital of which country?\nRESPONSE: Japan\n\nTASK\n====\nOutput a JSON object with:\n    1) a concise explanation of 15-60 words justifying your score based on how well the response is relevant to the query.\n    2) an integer score from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent) using the rubric below.\n\nThe explanation should always precede the score and should clearly justify the score based on the rubric definitions.\nResponse format exactly as follows:\n\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"<15-60 words>\",\n  \"score\": <1-5>\n}\n\n\nEVALUATION STEPS\n================\nA. Read the QUERY and RESPONSE carefully.\nB. Compare the RESPONSE against the rubric below:\n    - Does the response directly address the query?\n    - Is the information complete, partial, or off-topic?\n    - Is it vague, generic, or insightful?\nC. Match the response to the best score from the rubric.\nD. Provide a short explanation and the score using the required format.\n\nSCORING RUBRIC\n==============\n\n### Score 1 - Irrelevant Response\nDefinition: The response is unrelated to the question. It provides off-topic information and does not attempt to address the question posed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the team preparing for?\nRESPONSE: I went grocery shopping yesterday evening.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is entirely off-topic and doesn't address the question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: When will the company's new product line launch?\nRESPONSE: International travel can be very rewarding and educational.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is completely irrelevant to the product launch question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n### Score 2 – Related but Unhelpful / Superficial\nDefinition: The response is loosely or formally related to the query but fails to deliver any meaningful, specific, or useful information. This includes vague phrases, non-answers, or failure/error messages.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the event about?\nRESPONSE: It’s something important.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response vaguely refers to the query topic but lacks specific or informative content.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What’s the weather in Paris?\nRESPONSE: I tried to find the forecast but the query failed.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response acknowledges the query but provides no usable weather information. It is related but unhelpful.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n### Score 3 - Partially Relevant / Incomplete\nDefinition: The response addresses the query and includes relevant information, but omits essential components or detail. The answer is on-topic but insufficient to fully satisfy the request.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex has a gym.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions one amenity but does not provide a fuller list or clarify whether other standard features (like parking or security) are included. It partially addresses the query but lacks completeness.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: It includes priority customer support.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response identifies one service but omits other likely components of a premium membership (e.g., exclusive content or discounts). The information is relevant but incomplete.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n\n\n### Score 4 - Fully Relevant / Sufficient Response\nDefinition: The response fully addresses the question with accurate and sufficient information, covering all essential aspects. Very minor omissions are acceptable as long as the core information is intact and the intent is clearly conveyed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions multiple key amenities likely to be relevant to most users. While it may not list every feature, it clearly conveys the core offerings of the complex.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response outlines all major services expected from a premium membership. Even if a minor service is not mentioned, the core value is clearly and fully represented.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n\n### Score 5 - Comprehensive Response with Insights\nDefinition: The response not only fully and accurately answers the question, but also adds meaningful elaboration, interpretation, or context that enhances the user's understanding. This goes beyond just listing relevant details — it offers insight into why the information matters, how it's useful, or what impact it has.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security, designed to offer residents a comfortable and active lifestyle while ensuring their safety.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response fully lists key amenities and additionally explains how these features contribute to resident experience, enhancing the usefulness of the information.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases — tailored for users who want quicker resolutions and first access to new features.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response covers all essential services and adds valuable insight about the target user and benefits, enriching the response beyond basic listing.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}"

A coherent answer directly addresses the question with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs, using appropriate transitions and a logical sequence of ideas.\n\n# Ratings\n## [Coherence: 1] (Incoherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response lacks coherence entirely. It consists of disjointed words or phrases that do not form complete or meaningful sentences. There is no logical connection to the question, making the response incomprehensible.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What are the benefits of renewable energy?\n  **Response:** Wind sun green jump apple silence over.\n\n  **Query:** Explain the process of photosynthesis.\n  **Response:** Plants light water flying blue music.\n\n## [Coherence: 2] (Poorly Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response shows minimal coherence with fragmented sentences and limited connection to the question. It contains some relevant keywords but lacks logical structure and clear relationships between ideas, making the overall message difficult to understand.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** How does vaccination work?\n  **Response:** Vaccines protect disease. Immune system fight. Health better.\n\n  **Query:** Describe how a bill becomes a law.\n  **Response:** Idea proposed. Congress discuss vote. President signs.\n\n## [Coherence: 3] (Partially Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response partially addresses the question with some relevant information but exhibits issues in the logical flow and organization of ideas. Connections between sentences may be unclear or abrupt, requiring the reader to infer the links. The response may lack smooth transitions and may present ideas out of order.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What causes earthquakes?\n  **Response:** Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates move suddenly. Energy builds up then releases. Ground shakes and can cause damage.\n\n  **Query:** Explain the importance of the water cycle.\n  **Response:** The water cycle moves water around Earth. Evaporation, then precipitation occurs. It supports life by distributing water.\n\n## [Coherence: 4] (Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is coherent and effectively addresses the question. Ideas are logically organized with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs. Appropriate transitions are used to guide the reader through the response, which flows smoothly and is easy to follow.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What is the water cycle and how does it work?\n  **Response:** The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth through processes like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water evaporates from bodies of water, forms clouds through condensation, and returns to the surface as precipitation. This cycle is essential for distributing water resources globally.\n\n  **Query:** Describe the role of mitochondria in cellular function.\n  **Response:** Mitochondria are organelles that produce energy for the cell. They convert nutrients into ATP through cellular respiration. This energy powers various cellular activities, making mitochondria vital for cell survival.\n\n## [Coherence: 5] (Highly Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is exceptionally coherent, demonstrating sophisticated organization and flow. Ideas are presented in a logical and seamless manner, with excellent use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices. The connections between concepts are clear and enhance the reader's understanding. The response thoroughly addresses the question with clarity and precision.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** Analyze the economic impacts of climate change on coastal cities.\n  **Response:** Climate change significantly affects the economies of coastal cities through rising sea levels, increased flooding, and more intense storms. These environmental changes can damage infrastructure, disrupt businesses, and lead to costly repairs. For instance, frequent flooding can hinder transportation and commerce, while the threat of severe weather may deter investment and tourism. Consequently, cities may face increased expenses for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts, straining municipal budgets and impacting economic growth.\n\n  **Query:** Discuss the significance of the Monroe Doctrine in shaping U.S. foreign policy.\n  **Response:** The Monroe Doctrine was a pivotal policy declared in 1823 that asserted U.S. opposition to European colonization in the Americas. By stating that any intervention by external powers in the Western Hemisphere would be viewed as a hostile act, it established the U.S. as a protector of the region. This doctrine shaped U.S. foreign policy by promoting isolation from European conflicts while justifying American influence and expansion in the hemisphere. Its long-term significance lies in its enduring influence on international relations and its role in defining the U.S. position in global affairs.\n\n\n# Data\nQUERY: Tokyo is the capital of which country?\nRESPONSE: Japan\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above. Your output should include the following information:\n- **ThoughtChain**: To improve the reasoning process, think step by step and include a step-by-step explanation of your thought process as you analyze the data based on the definitions.

If the information and content in the predicted answer is similar or equivalent to the correct answer, then the value of the Equivalence metric should be high, else it should be low. Given the question, correct answer, and predicted answer, determine the value of Equivalence metric using the following rating scale:\nOne star: the predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer\nTwo stars: the predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer\nThree stars: the predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer\nFour stars: the predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer\nFive stars: the predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer\n\nThis rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.\n\nThe examples below show the Equivalence score for a question, a correct answer, and a predicted answer.\n\nquestion: What is the role of ribosomes?\ncorrect answer: Ribosomes are cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. They interpret the genetic information carried by messenger RNA (mRNA) and use it to assemble amino acids into proteins.\npredicted answer: Ribosomes participate in carbohydrate breakdown by removing nutrients from complex sugar molecules.\nstars: 1\n\nquestion: Why did the Titanic sink?\ncorrect answer: The Titanic sank after it struck an iceberg during its maiden voyage in 1912. The impact caused the ship's hull to breach, allowing water to flood into the vessel. The ship's design, lifeboat shortage, and lack of timely rescue efforts contributed to the tragic loss of life.\npredicted answer: The sinking of the Titanic was a result of a large iceberg collision. This caused the ship to take on water and eventually sink, leading to the death of many passengers due to a shortage of lifeboats and insufficient rescue attempts.\nstars: 2\n\nquestion: What causes seasons on Earth?\ncorrect answer: Seasons on Earth are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis and its revolution around the Sun. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt causes different parts of the planet to receive varying amounts of sunlight, resulting in changes in temperature and weather patterns.\npredicted answer: Seasons occur because of the Earth's rotation and its elliptical orbit around the Sun. The tilt of the Earth's axis causes regions to be subjected to different sunlight intensities, which leads to temperature fluctuations and alternating weather conditions.\nstars: 3\n\nquestion: How does photosynthesis work?\ncorrect answer: Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants and some other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. This occurs as light is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules, and then carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen through a series of reactions.\npredicted answer: In photosynthesis, sunlight is transformed into nutrients by plants and certain microorganisms. Light is captured by chlorophyll molecules, followed by the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen through multiple reactions.\nstars: 4\n\nquestion: What are the health benefits of regular exercise?\ncorrect answer: Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy weight, increase muscle and bone strength, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It also promotes mental well-being by reducing stress and improving overall mood.\npredicted answer: Routine physical activity can contribute to maintaining ideal body weight, enhancing muscle and bone strength, and preventing chronic illnesses. In addition, it supports mental health by alleviating stress and augmenting general mood.\nstars: 5\n\nquestion: Tokyo is the capital of which country?\ncorrect answer:Japan\npredicted answer: Japan\nstars:"
