This should capture the swirls, the heavy brushstrokes and vibrant, emotional colors found in the paintings of the Post-Impressionist era, primarily using oil painting as the medium. Through the use of these features, envision the towering skyscrapers and structures that make up the Seattle cityscape, and perhaps a glimpse of the iconic Space Needle. Try to infuse as much of the movement and intensity that is characteristic of Van Gogh's works.",
