The query context specifies that the customer wants to know the capital of Hawaii, and the response context provides the answer: \"Honolulu is the capital of Hawaii.\" Next, we evaluate the RESPONSE, which is \"Honolulu.\" The RESPONSE directly answers the query context by providing the capital of Hawaii. It does not introduce any unsupported information or omit any critical details necessary for understanding the main point. Therefore, the RESPONSE is fully grounded and complete according to the CONTEXT.</S0> <S1>The RESPONSE accurately and completely conveys the essential information from the CONTEXT without introducing unsupported details or omitting critical points.</S1> <S2>5</S2>",
