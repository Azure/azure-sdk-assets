              "content": "To provide the best advice on what to wear in Berlin today, I'll need to know the current weather conditions or the forecast for the day. If you don't have that information handy, I can give you general recommendations based on typical seasonal weather patterns.\n\n- **Spring (March to May)**: The weather can be quite variable. It's often cool, so layering is key. You might need a light jacket, a sweater, and a scarf. Comfortable shoes are advisable as it might be wet.\n\n- **Summer (June to August)**: Summers in Berlin are generally warm. Light, breathable fabrics are ideal. A t-shirt or a blouse, shorts or light trousers, and comfortable sandals or sneakers would work well. Don't forget sunglasses and sunscreen.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November)**: The weather starts to cool down, and it can be rainy. Layers work best, including a medium-weight jacket, long-sleeved tops, and jeans or trousers. Waterproof shoes or boots and an umbrella might come in handy.\n\n- **Winter (December to February)**: Berlin winters can be quite cold, so you'll need a warm coat, a hat, gloves, and a scarf. Layers of thermal wear, sweaters, and warm trousers are recommended. Sturdy, warm, and waterproof footwear is also essential.\n\nFor the most accurate advice, please check the local weather forecast for Berlin today and dress accordingly.",
