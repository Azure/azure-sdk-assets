Generally speaking, here are a few tips based on typical weather scenarios:\n\n1. **Spring (March to May)**:\n   - Layer with a light jacket or sweater, as temperatures can vary.\n   - Wear long sleeves and pants, and bring a scarf or hat for cooler mornings and evenings.\n\n2. **Summer (June to August)**:\n   - Lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton or linen are best.\n   - Shorts, t-shirts, and sundresses are suitable.\n   - Don’t forget sunglasses, sunscreen, and a hat for sun protection.\n\n3. **Autumn (September to November)**:\n   - Layering is key, with a mix of long sleeves, sweaters, and a medium-weight jacket.\n   - Be prepared for rain with a waterproof jacket and appropriate footwear.\n   - Jeans or trousers are suitable, with scarves and hats for added warmth.\n\n4. **Winter (December to February)**:\n   - Bundle up with a heavy winter coat, gloves, a hat, and a scarf.\n   - Wear thermal underwear, sweaters, and warm pants.\n   - Waterproof boots or shoes with good traction are recommended, as it can be snowy or icy.\n\nFor a precise recommendation, check today’s weather forecast for Berlin.",
