Given the question and answer, score the coherence of answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:\nOne star: the answer completely lacks coherence\nTwo stars: the answer mostly lacks coherence\nThree stars: the answer is partially coherent\nFour stars: the answer is mostly coherent\nFive stars: the answer has perfect coherency\n\nThis rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.\n\nquestion: What is your favorite indoor activity and why do you enjoy it?\nanswer: I like pizza.
