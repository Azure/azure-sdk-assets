        "text": "Skills and Abilities Batman has no inherent superpowers. He relies on his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess. In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world\u0027s greatest detectives, if not the world\u0027s greatest crime solver. Batman has been repeatedly described as having genius-level intellect, one of the greatest martial artists in the DC universe, and having peak human physical conditioning. He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid his crusade against crime. His knowledge and expertise in almost every discipline known to man is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the universe. Batman\u0027s inexhaustible wealth allows him to access advanced technology. As a proficient scientist, he is able to use and modify those technologies to his advantage. Batman describes Superman as the most dangerous man on Earth, able to defeat a team of super-powered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in the first storyline. Superman also considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet. Batman has the ability to function under great physical pain and withstand mind control. He is a master of disguise, multilingual, and an expert in espionage, often gathering information under different identities. Batman\u0027s karate, judo, and jujitsu training has made him a master of stealth and escape, allowing him to appear and disappear at will and to break free."
