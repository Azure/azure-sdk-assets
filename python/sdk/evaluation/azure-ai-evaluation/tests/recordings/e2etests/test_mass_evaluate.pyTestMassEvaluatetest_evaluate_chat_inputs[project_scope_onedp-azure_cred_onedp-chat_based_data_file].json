I really look forward to these meetings. It\\u2019s important to take time out and explicitly talk about the future and the direction we want the company to go in. Hoping to get some feedback on what\\u2019s happening now and ideas for the future. Loose agenda topics in the chat. Also happy to talk over whatever is top of mind for people.</v>,00:00:09.897 --> 00:00:17.487,<v Maria Campbell>Thanks Ben. For me the biggest concern right now is timing. We know that things are going to change. We\\u2019re going to hire and maybe promote and reorganize and have a lot of changes. But when? And in what time frame? I worry about everyone being able to get work done while these big shifts are happening.</v>,00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:25.537,<v Ji-hoon Park>That is important. If people are moving around or being given instructions to train new employees they\\u2019re going to be even busier than before. The people who do the most work already and are top performers are going to have more stress.</v>,00:00:25.537 --> 00:00:32.263,<v David Abelman>Timing for expansion is never perfect. Even when we know that we have slow down periods we have people out of office and some projects that are still on fire so there\\u2019s never a good time for big changes. It will be challenging for us all but we need to make sure that it\\u2019s as easy as possible for the people doing the work.</v>,00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:40.123,<v Emily Chaplin>I like Maria\\u2019s point about the time frame. Like do we want to onboard all the new people at once and have a ton of chaos but have it over quickly or do we want to bring on people and reorg in stages so there\\u2019s chaos for longer but it\\u2019s not so dramatic.</v>,00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:44.571,<v Matthew Martin>I don\\u2019t know if that looks different for different teams. This will hit writing and maybe data and graphics hardest. Heather what do you think?</v>,00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:51.551,<v Heather Horvath>The writing team is overworked but are really strong overall. The writers have already brought it up that when new people come on it will be a lift and they all want to help out. So we might partner new folks with established people on projects an then I would do a little less in terms of training.</v>,00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:55.205,<v Heather Horvath>Darius brought up the point that we might want to divide up the team by specialties or some other factor. Have cohorts or groups.</v>,00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:56.514,<v Hurrit Alberty>Would you put people in charge of those cohorts?</v>,00:00:56.514 --> 00:01:00.458,<v Heather Horvath>Not necessarily. I can\\u2019t ask someone to be in charge and have leadership duties if they don\\u2019t get a promotion and a raise.</v>,00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:07.570,<v Heather Horvath>If we could do promotions and raises for a different leadership structure, that would be great. If not, I would use this kind of organization to better manage small groups. It would focus communications like people working on best and fabric cam as opposed to the really different goals and concerns for people on north wind and prose wear.</v>,00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.418,<v Benjamin Novak>If there were the option for promotions to manage cohorts, who would you choose and how quickly do you think the changes could go into effect?</v>,00:01:11.418 --> 00:01:16.518,<v Heather Horvath>That\\u2019s easy. Helen and Darius. They would be ready to manage cohorts immediately. They\\u2019re both so good. And if we bring on new writers and or contractors they would be able to help get everyone up and running easily. No question.</v>,00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:21.846,<v Maria Campbell>I completely agree. We have a really mature group of people to lead writing who can roll with changes and keep things in order. Not all departments are going to be able to do that but the writers will be fine.</v>,00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:25.042,<v David Abelman>From what I\\u2019ve seen that\\u2019s mostly because of your leadership Heather.</v>,00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:27.758,<v Emily Chaplin>It\\u2019s definitely because of Heather and how well she\\u2019s managed the team especially over the past year.</v>,00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:31.008,<v Matthew Martin>We won\\u2019t have that easy a time with data or graphic design I think.</v>,00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.908,<v Ji-hoon Park>Definitely not with graphic design. We have had to rely more on vendors as the workload has increased. Mohammed could take on more responsibility but I don\\u2019t think Ed or Jen could. And we\\u2019re so understaffed that the time we would risk getting behind on project work.</v>,00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:37.534,<v Benjamin Novak>If you could hire three people today would it help? Do you have anyone in mind?</v>,00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:42.718,<v Ji-hoon Park>I would take two of the contractors but we would have to search for someone with specialization in mobile app design. It\\u2019s the one skill set that we\\u2019re really missing. Everyone on the team can do some of it but not to the level we really need. We prioritized other skill sets in the past. We could also use more animation experience and maybe someone who is really good with AI.</v>,00:01:42.718 --> 00:01:45.282,<v Benjamin Novak>Okay that\\u2019s something I didn\\u2019t know. Good call out. Can you grab time with me next week to give me a quick overview of specializations and your thoughts on what we have and what we need?</v>,00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:46.226,<v Ji-hoon Park>Of course.</v>,00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:48.538,<v Benjamin Novak>Matthew Jake tell me about data.</v>,00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:50.898,<v Matthew Martin>We\\u2019re struggling. For different reasons.</v>,00:01:50.898 --> 00:01:53.286,<v Hurrit Alberty>Yeah. We don\\u2019t have enough data scientists or other analysts to begin with. And there has been some tension on the team. Matt.</v>,00:01:53.286 --> 00:01:54.046,<v Matthew Martin>Hmm.</v>,00:01:54.046 --> 00:02:00.146,<v Matthew Martin>So I think that data science is a special case in terms of reorganizing and getting some new people. We need more extensive changes and have talked to Suresh about that.</v>,00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:04.482,<v Hurrit Alberty>It\\u2019s in progress but it will take a bit of time. I think everyone here is familiar with the issue.</v>,00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:09.538,<v Matthew Martin>I think we should sort of leave this out right now. Too many things happening and we want to be careful.</v>,00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:10.102,<v Hurrit Alberty>It\\u2019s.</v>,00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:11.582,<v Hurrit Alberty>It\\u2019s something that we will deal with. Things will get better.</v>,00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:13.022,<v Matthew Martin>Exactly. Let\\u2019s leave it at that.</v>,00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:28.258,<v Benjamin Novak>Okay then. Speaking of change let\\u2019s talk about some of the ideas people have been kicking around lately like the expansion of roles we want to see at the company.</v>,00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:32.035,<v Heather Horvath>Oh good. I was hoping we\\u2019d get into this. </v>,00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:36.099,<v Hurrit Alberty>Yeah. I think this is really smart. Some companies have done a lot of this and some aren\\u2019t doing it at all.</v>,00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.552,<v Benjamin Novak>Yeah. People are all over the place when it comes to ideas like this.</v>,00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:51.568,<v Maria Campbell>I think what it comes down to is that no one really knows what\\u2019s going to work or what the right answer is. Or what the right skill sets are to have at an agency today. But the world has changed a lot in a very short time. And also some things have been changing for years and are just hitting a tipping point.</v>,00:02:51.568 --> 00:03:05.361,<v David Abelman>That sounds right. Like data has been ruling everyone\\u2019s lives for over a decade. But it was data for the sake of data. Quality took a nosedive and we\\u2019re all just choking on it. The idea of data as a part of a larger structure to make decisions is the future I think.</v>,00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:24.271,<v Emily Chaplin>In terms of what that means exactly it\\u2019s hard to say but I think we can afford to be innovative. I\\u2019d love to see a psychologist, a sociologist and maybe someone with an interdisciplinary background that has diversity and bias training in communications. That one will be tricky. Those people want to go to nonprofits or academia. They usually want to avoid advertising like the plague.</v>,00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:39.077,<v Matthew Martin>:If we find the right person I think we can make a compelling offer. If it\\u2019s an issue of ethics or not being able to work on things that are meaningful we can be really accommodating. Suresh absolutely loves some of the volunteer and pro bono projects people have taken on. It\\u2019s one of the reasons he\\u2019s thinking of expanding the hiring more than we technically need.</v>,00:03:39.077 --> 00:03:44.847,<v Heather Horvath>I do think we offer things that aren\\u2019t really standard in the space and we should be proud of that.</v>,00:03:44.847 --> 00:03:54.390,<v Hurrit Alberty>And having people like that to analyze data and collaborate with the writers and clients and everyone could be very valuable. It\\u2019s never been harder to be in advertising. People are frustrated with being sold to and want different experiences.</v>,00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:11.230,<v Benjamin Novak>That\\u2019s the real issue isn\\u2019t it. It\\u2019s a tough market. Everyone wants something different but we still see trends just not the way we used to. And different people who look at data and the world in different ways are going to be able to give us insights that might be able to set us apart from other firms.</v>,00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:22.183,<v Maria Campbell>I think people with those skill sets would also be able to help us navigate social media and publicity incidents better. And advise clients on how to handle them better.</v>,00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:29.772,<v Ji-hoon Park>I agree. But would staff in more traditional areas feel like their roles are less important or their voices aren\\u2019t heard if we go in that direction?</v>,00:04:29.772 --> 00:04:35.898,<v David Abelman>I think most of our staff would be interested. Some people may feel.</v>,00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:43.366,<v David Abelman>Have feelings about it but if we integrate everyone well and emphasize teamwork and roles they should be able to get past it.</v>,00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:48.647,<v Emily Chaplin>I could see Zack Crane and Jenn Scott pushing back on things like this.</v>,00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:51.698,<v Matthew Martin>They have some very static ideas about the world.</v>,00:04:51.698 --> 00:05:01.689,<v Heather Horvath>I think they are more extreme in their beliefs and try to keep that to themselves at work but it slips out. Jenn loves to hint at how she has voted in the past. Mostly when it seems clear that someone in the conversation voted a different way.</v>,00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:16.579,<v Hurrit Alberty>I don\\u2019t like to assume how anyone votes but I most of our staff are educated professionals who live in cities and a good percentage of them are not white, so statistically they tend to go a certain way. And I\\u2019ve had enough personal conversations with people to confirm that.</v>,00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:22.450,<v Benjamin Novak>Yeah. We shouldn\\u2019t talk about this kind of thing at work but we do. And with the emphasis that we have on being active in social campaigns and volunteer projects it does come up.</v>,00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:40.661,<v Maria Campbell>It does. But people are respectful. Even people who mostly share the same beliefs vote differently sometimes. I know that the Latino community has a large percentage of Republican voters. They vote that way for complicated reasons. Mike Garcia is always pretty quiet in conversations about politics. I think because he isn\\u2019t sold on progressivism in the same way that most of his friends are.</v>,00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:48.935,<v Ji-hoon Park>I would guess that Jorje and Rajesh are independents or Republicans as well.</v>,00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:53.494,<v David Abelman>I know we shouldn\\u2019t speculate like this but that tracks. I bet Jorje and Rajesh are libertarians.</v>,00:05:53.494 --> 00:05:56.835,<v Emily Chaplin>Chris Ivanko definitely votes Republican.</v>,00:05:56.835 --> 00:05:59.827,<v Matthew Martin>Maybe Haruto too.</v>,00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:03.921,<v Heather Horvath>Is Haruto a citizen? Can he vote?</v>,00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:11.296,<v Hurrit Alberty>Good question. I don\\u2019t know how long ago he came to the US. He\\u2019s not an easy guy to talk to.</v>,00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:21.924,<v Maria Campbell>I\\u2019ve tried but he likes to stick to one word answers and just doesn\\u2019t engage at all. He talks to Chris and maybe a few other people but is really closed off.</v>,00:06:21.924 --> 00:06:29.082,<v Ji-hoon Park>Well anyone who prefers Chris\\u2019 company to yours certainly is making a choice.</v>,00:06:31.262 --> 00:06:32.512,<v David Abelman>Truer words have never been spoken.</v>,00:06:32.737 --> 00:06:35.487,<v Emily Chaplin>If we bring that sociologist on we should ask them to analyze our staff. </v>,00:06:35.737 --> 00:06:37.537,<v Matthew Martin>Same for the psychologist. </v>,00:06:37.787 --> 00:06:39.912,<v Benjamin Novak>Ha. How did we end up talking about this? </v>,00:06:40.162 --> 00:06:43.287,<v Benjamin Novak>Let\\u2019s finish up the business stuff first and then gossip if there\\u2019s time.</v>,00:06:43.662 --> 00:06:45.512,<v Heather Horvath>Ben is always the adult in the room.</v>,00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:48.837,<v Hurrit Alberty>Ben one last thing on roles and skill sets. The one department that hasn\\u2019t come up is sales.</v>,00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:50.462,<v Benjamin Novak>Oh. Okay. Yeah.</v>,00:06:50.737 --> 00:07:05.662,<v Hurrit Alberty>It\\u2019s a super saturated environment. Trends are all over the place. Sometimes it\\u2019s really dependent on personality other times it\\u2019s really buttoned up and strictly business. I don\\u2019t know what moves the needle on improving and innovating in sales. I would be that it\\u2019s not more people doing the same prestige NBA programs from top universities. Everything in sales feels old.</v>,00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:13.412,<v Maria Campbell>Sales in general is stuck in the two thousands. Events and swag and drinks. Eventifying. Except when you get one of those teams that just want to talk numbers and data which doesn\\u2019t feel innovative either.</v>,00:07:13.687 --> 00:07:19.287,<v Benjamin Novak>Those are great points. That actually might need more of an investigation. We should loop Dave Nolan in on this team. He would be in the best position to investigate that.</v>,00:07:19.562 --> 00:07:21.912,<v Ji-hoon Park>She I mean he is definitely the best person for the job.</v>,00:07:22.212 --> 00:07:24.362,<v David Abelman>I bet Dave will have great ideas about this.</v>,00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:28.587,<v Emily Chaplin>Yeah. Curious to hear what she says about which specialties are most relevant. He is really thoughtful about that kind of thing.</v>,00:07:28.887 --> 00:07:32.487,<v Benjamin Novak>And I\\u2019ll add him to the invite for this series in the future. Don\\u2019t know how I overlooked him.</v>,00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:35.037,<v Matthew Martin>If we are expanding and reorganizing will she be promoted?</v>,00:07:35.312 --> 00:07:38.987,<v Benjamin Novak>Maybe. We haven\\u2019t talked as much about sales so we don\\u2019t know what we really want there.</v>,00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:40.637,<v Heather Horvath>The sales team is a mix of characters. Which I think is good. But.</v>,00:07:41.037 --> 00:07:43.687,<v Heather Horvath>It will be interesting to see the types of personalities and skills that are prioritized in the future.</v>,00:07:44.012 --> 00:07:45.462,<v Hurrit Alberty>Heather being quite the diplomat.</v>,00:07:45.737 --> 00:07:47.337,<v Benjamin Novak>Heh heh. Yeah. It\\u2019s a colorful group of people.</v>,00:07:47.662 --> 00:07:50.887,<v Maria Campbell>Different clients want different things so our very diverse team can bring that to them.</v>,00:07:51.187 --> 00:07:52.937,<v Ji-hoon Park>True. But perhaps in this case some extra attention is needed. </v>,00:07:53.262 --> 00:07:55.862,<v David Abelman>Let\\u2019s talk about this more when Dave is on the call. His is the opinion that matters.</v>,00:07:56.187 --> 00:07:57.087,<v Emily Chaplin>Good call.</v>,00:07:57.387 --> 00:07:58.287,<v Matthew Martin>Yeah.</v>,00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:03.912,<v Benjamin Novak>Okay. So I think that about covers it. Sorry I don\\u2019t have more solid things to report just yet. There are going to be a lot of changes coming but we really are trying to be thoughtful and figure out how to expand in a way that makes sense and is best for everyone on staff and for business. You all have said what you want and need and we are listening. Will be making the first moves on everything sometime in the next few weeks.</v>,00:08:04.237 --> 00:08:07.762,<v Heather Horvath>Thanks for the update Ben. I know everything will be fine. Better than fine. Great.</v>,00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:12.987,<v Hurrit Alberty>Excited for the future. A lot of people are really nervous about the world and work and everything but things here seem really positive and like it only gets even better.</v>,00:08:13.312 --> 00:08:19.012,<v Benjamin Novak>That\\u2019s great to hear Jake. We are trying and I think your right that things are great and continuing to get even better. And that\\u2019s all on you and your teams. So we\\u2019re going to try to reward everyone and make things grow in a way that maintains everything that has gotten us this far.</v>,00:08:19.337 --> 00:08:21.087,<v Maria Campbell>Well said Ben.</v>,00:08:21.437 --> 00:08:25.912,<v Benjamin Novak>Thanks. If that\\u2019s all I\\u2019ll give you all some time back. Stay tuned. I\\u2019ll be reaching out over chat and probably asking for time one on one or in small groups as we get things in place and start making changes.</v>,00:08:26.237 --> 00:08:27.287,<v Ji-hoon Park>Thanks Ben.</v>,00:08:27.637 --> 00:08:28.537,<v David Abelman>Thanks all. Bye.</v>,00:08:28.887 --> 00:08:29.537,<v Emily Chaplin>Bye.</v>,00:08:29.887 --> 00:08:31.337,<v Matthew Martin>Have a good day everyone.</v>,00:08:31.687 --> 00:08:32.337,<v Heather Horvath>Bye.</v>\"}"
