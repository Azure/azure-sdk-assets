Abstract swirls of color, akin to Van Gogh's use of bold and emotive brushstrokes, fill the sky, mirroring the artist's vision in 'Starry Night'. The vibrant dashes and strokes of paint capture the city's dynamic energy, while echoes of the post-impressionist era reflect upon the water. Remember to employ the primary mediums of oil paint and canvas texture prevalent in the artist's works.",
