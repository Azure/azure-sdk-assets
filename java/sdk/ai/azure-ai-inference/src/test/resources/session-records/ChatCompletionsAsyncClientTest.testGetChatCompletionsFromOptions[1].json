              "content": "To give you the most accurate advice on what to wear today in Berlin, I would need to know the current weather conditions. Generally, checking the weather forecast is a good starting point. Here are some general guidelines based on typical weather scenarios:\n\n1. **Spring (March to May):**\n   - **Cool Mornings/Evenings:** Light jacket or sweater.\n   - **Warmer Afternoons:** Layered clothing so you can adjust throughout the day.\n   - **Shoes:** Comfortable walking shoes, as Berlin is a city best explored on foot.\n\n2. **Summer (June to August):**\n   - **Hot Days:** Light, breathable fabrics like cotton or linen. Shorts, t-shirts, and dresses are ideal.\n   - **Occasional Rain:** Carry a light rain jacket or umbrella.\n   - **Footwear:** Sandals or comfortable walking shoes.\n\n3. **Autumn (September to November):**\n   - **Cooler Temperatures:** Layered clothing, including long-sleeved shirts, sweaters, and a medium-weight jacket.\n   - **Variable Weather:** Be prepared for rain with a waterproof jacket or umbrella.\n   - **Shoes:** Sturdy shoes, possibly waterproof, for wet conditions.\n\n4. **Winter (December to February):**\n   - **Cold Weather:** Heavy coat, hat, gloves, scarf, and warm layers. Thermal wear can be very helpful.\n   - **Occasional Snow/Ice:** Boots with good traction.\n   - **Indoor Heating:** Wear layers that you can remove when indoors.\n\nSpecific accessories like sunglasses, hats, and scarves can also be good additions, depending on the weather. Always check a reliable weather forecast for the most accurate information.",
