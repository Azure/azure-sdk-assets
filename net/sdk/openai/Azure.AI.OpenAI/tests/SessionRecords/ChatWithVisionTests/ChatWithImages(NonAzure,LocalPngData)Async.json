The deer to the left is slightly larger and is facing the camera head-on with its ears perked up. The smaller deer, to the right, is turning its head towards the camera, showing its profile. Both deers have white spots on their coats, a trait typical of fallow deer, and they both appear alert and attentive. The background displays a variety of autumn colors in the foliage, with different shades of yellows, oranges, and browns. The depth of field is shallow, keeping the focus on the deer while softly blurring the background, which enhances the natural beauty and tranquility of the scene."
