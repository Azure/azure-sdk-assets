The city's modern architecture meets harmoniously the swirling patterns and vivid, contrasting colors that the Dutch post-impressionist artist was famous for. Remember to capture the essence of the dynamic cityscape with a light and color scheme reminiscent of Van Gogh, including the iconic Space Needle and other representative buildings. Blend this representation with an expressive sky, copious in brush strokes resembling his painting Starry Night. Use oil paint as the medium to stay true to Van Gogh's artistic method.",
