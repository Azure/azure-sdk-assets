              "content": "There are several ways to cook a bell pepper, depending on the recipe you're following. Here are a few methods:\n\n1. Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for about 25-30 minutes, or until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n2. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cut the peppers into large flat pieces, remove the seeds, and brush both sides with olive oil. Grill for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n3. Sautéing: Cut the peppers into thin slices or small chunks. Heat a pan over medium heat, add some oil, and then add the peppers. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes, or until the peppers are tender.\n\n4. Boiling: Cut the peppers into pieces and remove the seeds. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the peppers, and boil for about 5 minutes, or until the peppers are tender.\n\n5. Stuffed: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Cut off the tops of the peppers and remove the seeds. Fill the peppers with a stuffing of your choice (like cooked rice, meat, and vegetables), place them in a baking dish, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the stuffing is heated through.\n\nRemember to always wash the peppers thoroughly before cooking.",
