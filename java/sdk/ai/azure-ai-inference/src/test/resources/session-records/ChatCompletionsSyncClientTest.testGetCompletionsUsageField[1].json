              "content": "To give you accurate advice on what to wear in Berlin today, I need to know the current weather conditions. However, I can provide general suggestions based on typical seasonal weather in Berlin:\n\n- **Spring (March to May)**: The weather can be quite unpredictable. Layering is key. Wear a light jacket or sweater, comfortable pants, and bring an umbrella just in case.\n  \n- **Summer (June to August)**: Summers can be warm to hot. Opt for light clothing like t-shirts, shorts, dresses, and comfortable shoes. Don't forget sunglasses, sunscreen, and a hat.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November)**: It starts to get cooler, especially in the evenings. Wear a light to medium jacket, sweaters, long pants, and perhaps a scarf.\n\n- **Winter (December to February)**: Winters are cold and can be snowy. Wear a heavy coat, layers, a hat, gloves, and a scarf to stay warm.\n\nFor todayâ€™s specific recommendations, you might want to check a reliable weather forecast for Berlin. Websites like Weather.com or apps like AccuWeather can give you up-to-date information.",
