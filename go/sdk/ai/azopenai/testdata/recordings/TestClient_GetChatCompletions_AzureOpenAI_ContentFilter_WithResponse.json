              "content": "There are several ways to cook a bell pepper:\n\n1. Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n2. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cut the peppers into large flat pieces, remove the seeds and brush both sides with olive oil. Grill for 4-5 minutes on each side until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n3. Sautéing: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Heat a pan over medium heat, add some oil and then add the peppers. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until the peppers are soft and slightly caramelized.\n\n4. Steaming: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Place the peppers in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water. Cover and steam for 5-7 minutes until the peppers are tender.\n\n5. Stuffed: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Cut the tops off the peppers and remove the seeds. Fill the peppers with a stuffing of your choice (like cooked rice, meat, vegetables, and cheese), place them in a baking dish and bake for 30-40 minutes until the peppers are soft and the stuffing is heated through.\n\nRemember to always wash the peppers thoroughly before cooking.",
