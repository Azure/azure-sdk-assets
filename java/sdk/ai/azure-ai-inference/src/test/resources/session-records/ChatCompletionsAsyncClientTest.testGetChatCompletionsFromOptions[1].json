              "content": "To give you the best advice on what to wear in Berlin today, I would need to know the current weather conditions. Typically, checking a reliable weather forecast source for Berlin will provide you with the day's temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions. \n\nHowever, I can provide some general advice based on typical weather patterns in Berlin:\n\n- **Spring (March to May):** Layers are essential. It can be quite variable with temperatures ranging between 5°C to 18°C. A light jacket or sweater, along with a t-shirt or long-sleeve shirt, should be fine.\n  \n- **Summer (June to August):** Berlin can be quite warm with temperatures ranging from 16°C to 30°C. Light, breathable fabrics like cotton are ideal. T-shirts, shorts, skirts, and dresses are typical, but bring a light jacket for cooler evenings.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November):** Similar to spring, layering is key. Temperatures can range from 5°C to 20°C. A warm jacket or coat, along with sweaters and long pants, is a good idea. An umbrella or raincoat might also be necessary due to occasional rain.\n\n- **Winter (December to February):** It can be quite cold, with temperatures often ranging from -5°C to 5°C. A warm winter coat, gloves, a hat, and a scarf are essential. Layers like thermal underwear, sweaters, and heavy pants will help keep you warm.\n\nAlways consider the possibility of rain and have an umbrella or waterproof jacket handy. Checking the weather forecast just before you head out will provide you with the most accurate information to make your clothing decisions.",
