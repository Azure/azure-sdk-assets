              "content": "1. Wash: Before you begin cooking, always wash your bell pepper under cool or lukewarm water. Wipe it dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towel.\n\n2. Cut: Use a sharp knife to cut off the top and the bottom of the bell pepper. Next, cut around the core to remove it. You should then be left with the bell pepper itself. Depending on your recipe, you may need to slice the bell pepper into strips or chop it into chunks.\n\n3. Cooking Methods:\n\n   - Roasting: Preheat your oven to 450\u00B0F (232\u00B0C). Place the bell pepper pieces on a baking sheet lined with aluminium foil. Drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast until the skin is blistered and the peppers are tender (15 to 20 minutes).\n\n   - Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Brush the bell pepper pieces with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the peppers with the lid closed for about 10 minutes, until they have nice grill marks and are softened. \n\n   - Stir-frying: Heat a pan over medium heat and add some oil. Once the oil is hot, add the bell pepper pieces and stir-fry for about 5 minutes, until they\u2019re tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n   - Stuffing: Preheat your oven to 375\u00B0F (190\u00B0C). Remove the tops of the bell peppers and scoop out the seeds and membranes. Stuff bell peppers with your favorite filling (like cooked ground meat, rice, and veggies), top with cheese, and bake until the peppers are soft (about 30 minutes).\n\nNote: De-seeding and removing the pith from bell peppers can make them taste less bitter. Also, if you\u2019re roasting or grilling them, you can remove the skin after cooking for a sweeter flavor."
