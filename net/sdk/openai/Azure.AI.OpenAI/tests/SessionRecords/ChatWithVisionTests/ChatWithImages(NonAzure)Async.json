The ferns are a mix of green, brown, and orange hues, indicating a change of season. The deer appear to be quite alert and are looking directly at the camera, giving a sense of curiosity or cautiousness. Their coats have white spots, which is characteristic of certain deer species, such as the European fallow deer, especially when they are young or of a variation that retains spotted fur throughout their lives. The background is softly focused but suggests a woodland scene with more autumn-colored foliage. The lighting is soft and diffused, which could indicate the photo was taken on an overcast day or during the \u0022golden hour\u0022 when the sun is lower in the sky."
