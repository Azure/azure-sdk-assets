              "content": "The right clothing for today depends on the current weather conditions in Berlin. Here are a few steps to determine the best outfit:\n\n1. **Check the Weather Forecast**: Use a reliable weather app or website to get the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.\n\n2. **Temperature Guidelines**:\n   - **Below 0°C (32°F)**: Layers, thermal wear, a heavy coat, hat, gloves, scarf, and insulated boots.\n   - **0°C to 10°C (32°F to 50°F)**: A warm jacket or coat, sweater, long sleeves, and possibly a hat and gloves.\n   - **10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F)**: A lighter jacket or sweater, long-sleeve shirts, pants, and comfortable shoes.\n   - **20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F)**: Light layers, such as T-shirts, light sweaters, jeans or lighter pants.\n   - **Above 25°C (77°F)**: Summer clothing, such as T-shirts, shorts, dresses, and sandals.\n\n3. **Precipitation**:\n   - **Rain**: Waterproof jacket, umbrella, and possibly waterproof footwear.\n   - **Snow**: Insulated outerwear, warm accessories, and waterproof boots.\n   - **Clear**: Generally no special considerations for water resistance.\n\n4. **Wind**: A windproof jacket can be beneficial if the wind speed is high, particularly in colder temperatures.\n\n5. **Activities**: Consider what you'll be doing. Dress more casually and comfortably for walking or outdoor activities, and smarter or more professionally if you're attending meetings or events.\n\nTo give specific advice, please share the current weather conditions in Berlin or check a weather forecasting service and dress according to the guidance above.",
