There are a number of reasons for a high monocyte count, which can also be called monocytosis. Some of the reasons can include stress, viral fevers, inflammation and organ necrosis. A physician may order a monocyte blood count test to check for raised levels of monocytes. There are a number of reasons for this test, from a simple health check up to people suffering from heart attacks and leukemia. Complications with the blood and cancer are two other reasons that this test may be performed.\", \"Monocytes are considered the largest white blood cell.

No external knowledge is used to influence the ranking of the chunks; the system only relies on the provided context. Factual accuracy remains out of scope for evaluation.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** do game shows pay their contestants\n  **Context:** [\"So, in the end, game show winners get some of the money that TV advertisers pay to the networks, who pay the show producers, who then pay the game show winners. Just in the same way that the actors, and crew of a show get paid.

Meet the eligibility requirements. All game shows have certain eligibility requirements for their contestants. Generally, you must be at least 18 years of age, except for those shows that use child or teenage contestants, and you are allowed to appear on no more than 1 game show per year.\", \"Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: You don't always win the money amount on the front of your lectern when you are on a game show. As someone else said, 2nd place earns $2000 and 3rd place earns $1000 in Jeopardy! In any case, the prize money is paid out from the ad revenue that the show receives from sponsors. I think in this case Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Deal or No Deal is the best example of how shows can be successful while still paying the prize money. I feel this way because these shows have a potential, however small it may be, to pay out 1 million dollars to every contestant on the show. Here is the reality. Regardless of the show whether it be a game show or a drama, a network will receive money from commercial advertising based on the viewership. With this in mind a game show costs very little to actually air compared to a full production drama series, that's where the prize money comes from\"]\n\n## [Retrieval: 5] (Highly Relevant, Well Ranked, No Bias Introduced)\n**Definition:** The context chunks not only fully address the query, but also surface the most relevant chunks at the top of the list. The retrieval respects the internal context, avoids relying on any outside knowledge, and focuses solely on pulling the most useful content to the forefront, irrespective of the factual correctness of the information.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** The smallest blood vessels in your body, where gas exchange occurs are called\n  **Context:** [\"Gas exchange is the delivery of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream, and the elimination of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream to the lungs. It occurs in the lungs between the alveoli and a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries, which are located in the walls of the alveoli. The walls of the alveoli actually share a membrane with the capillaries in which oxygen and carbon dioxide move freely between the respiratory system and the bloodstream.\", \"Arterioles branch into capillaries, the smallest of all blood vessels. Capillaries are the sites of nutrient and waste exchange between the blood and body cells. Capillaries are microscopic vessels that join the arterial system with the venous system.\", \"Arterioles are the smallest arteries and regulate blood flow into capillary beds through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Capillaries are the smallest vessels and allow for exchange of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid. Continuous capillaries are most common and allow passage of fluids and small solutes. Fenestrated capillaries are more permeable to fluids and solutes than continuous capillaries.\", \"Tweet. The smallest blood vessels in the human body are capillaries. They are responsible for the absorption of oxygen into the blood stream and for removing the deoxygenated red blood cells for return to the heart and lungs for reoxygenation.\", \"2. Capillaries—these are the sites of gas exchange between the tissues. 3. Veins—these return oxygen poor blood to the heart, except for the vein that carries blood from the lungs.

In any case, the prize money is paid out from the ad revenue that the show receives from sponsors. I think in this case Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Deal or No Deal is the best example of how shows can be successful while still paying the prize money. I feel this way because these shows have a potential, however small it may be, to pay out 1 million dollars to every contestant on the show. Here is the reality. Regardless of the show whether it be a game show or a drama, a network will receive money from commercial advertising based on the viewership. With this in mind a game show costs very little to actually air compared to a full production drama series, that's where the prize money comes from\"]\n\n## [Retrieval: 5] (Highly Relevant, Well Ranked, No Bias Introduced)\n**Definition:** The context chunks not only fully address the query, but also surface the most relevant chunks at the top of the list.

Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that fights off bacteria, viruses and fungi. Monocytes are the biggest type of white blood cell in the immune system. Originally formed in the bone marrow, they are released into our blood and tissues. When certain germs enter the body, they quickly rush to the site for attack.\", \"Monocyte. Monocytes are produced by the bone marrow from stem cell precursors called monoblasts. Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body. They make up three to eight percent of the leukocytes in the blood. Monocyte under a light microscope (40x) from a peripheral blood smear surrounded by red blood cells. Monocytes are a type of white blood cell, part of the human body's immune system. They are usually identified in stained smears by their large two-lobed nucleus.\", \"A monocyte (pictured below) is a large type of white blood cell with one large, smooth, well-defined, indented, slightly folded, oval, kidney-shaped, or notched nucleus (the cell's control center). White blood cells help protect the body against diseases and fight infections.\", \"Monocytes are white blood cells that are common to the blood of all vertebrates and they help the immune system to function properly. There are a number of reasons for a high monocyte count, which can also be called monocytosis. Some of the reasons can include stress, viral fevers, inflammation and organ necrosis. A physician may order a monocyte blood count test to check for raised levels of monocytes. There are a number of reasons for this test, from a simple health check up to people suffering from heart attacks and leukemia. Complications with the blood and cancer are two other reasons that this test may be performed.\", \"Monocytes are considered the largest white blood cell. These cells are part of the innate immune system. Monocytes also play important roles in the immune function of the body. These cells are often found when doing a stained smear and appear large kidney shaped. Many of these are found in the spleen area.\", \"This is taken directly from-http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-monocytes.htm#. Monocytes are a type of leukocyte or white blood cell which play a role in immune system function. Depending on a patient's level of health, monocytes make up between one and three percent of the total white blood cells in the body. For example, if monocytes are elevated because of an inflammation caused by a viral infection, the patient would be given medication to kill the virus and bring down the inflammation. Typically, when a monocyte count is requested, the lab will also run other tests on the blood to generate a complete picture.\", \"3D Rendering of a Monocyte. Monocytes are a type of white blood cells (leukocytes). They are the largest of all leukocytes. They are part of the innate immune system of vertebrates including all mammals (humans included), birds, reptiles, and fish. Monocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to other tissues will then differentiate into tissue resident macrophages or dendritic cells. Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances, but are also suspected to be important in the formation of important organs like the heart and brain.\"]\n\n  **Query:** What were the key features of the Magna Carta?\n  **Context:** [\"The Magna Carta influenced the legal system in Europe, especially in constitutional law.\", \"It was signed in 1215 by King John of England to limit the powers of the monarchy.\", \"The Magna Carta introduced principles like due process and habeas corpus, which are key features of modern legal systems.\"]\n\n## [Retrieval: 4] (Relevant Context Ranked Middle, No External Knowledge Bias and Factual Accuracy Ignored)\n**Definition:** The context chunks fully address the query, but the most relevant chunk is ranked in the middle of the list. No external knowledge is used to influence the ranking of the chunks; the system only relies on the provided context. Factual accuracy remains out of scope for evaluation.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** do game shows pay their contestants\n  **Context:** [\"So, in the end, game show winners get some of the money that TV advertisers pay to the networks, who pay the show producers, who then pay the game show winners. Just in the same way that the actors, and crew of a show get paid. Game shows, like other programs, have costs to produce the programs—they have to pay for sets, cameras, talent (the hosts), and also prizes to contestants.\", \"(Valerie Macon/Getty Images). Oh, happy day! You're a contestant on a popular game show—The Price Is Right, let's say. You spin the wheel, you make the winning bid, and suddenly—ka-ching!—you've won the Lexus or the dishwasher or the lifetime supply of nail clippers.\", \"1 If you can use most of the prizes the show offers, such as a new car or trip, you may be content to appear on a game show that features material prizes. 2 If not, you should probably try out for a show where cash is the main prize. 3 In the United States, game show contestants must pay taxes on any prizes they win. 2. Meet the eligibility requirements. All game shows have certain eligibility requirements for their contestants. Generally, you must be at least 18 years of age, except for those shows that use child or teenage contestants, and you are allowed to appear on no more than 1 game show per year.\", \"Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: You don't always win the money amount on the front of your lectern when you are on a game show. As someone else said, 2nd place earns $2000 and 3rd place earns $1000 in Jeopardy! In any case, the prize money is paid out from the ad revenue that the show receives from sponsors. I think in this case Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Deal or No Deal is the best example of how shows can be successful while still paying the prize money. I feel this way because these shows have a potential, however small it may be, to pay out 1 million dollars to every contestant on the show. Here is the reality. Regardless of the show whether it be a game show or a drama, a network will receive money from commercial advertising based on the viewership. With this in mind a game show costs very little to actually air compared to a full production drama series, that's where the prize money comes from\"]\n\n## [Retrieval: 5] (Highly Relevant, Well Ranked, No Bias Introduced)\n**Definition:** The context chunks not only fully address the query, but also surface the most relevant chunks at the top of the list.

It occurs in the lungs between the alveoli and a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries, which are located in the walls of the alveoli. The walls of the alveoli actually share a membrane with the capillaries in which oxygen and carbon dioxide move freely between the respiratory system and the bloodstream.\", \"Arterioles branch into capillaries, the smallest of all blood vessels. Capillaries are the sites of nutrient and waste exchange between the blood and body cells. Capillaries are microscopic vessels that join the arterial system with the venous system.\", \"Arterioles are the smallest arteries and regulate blood flow into capillary beds through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Capillaries are the smallest vessels and allow for exchange of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid. Continuous capillaries are most common and allow passage of fluids and small solutes. Fenestrated capillaries are more permeable to fluids and solutes than continuous capillaries.\", \"Tweet. The smallest blood vessels in the human body are capillaries. They are responsible for the absorption of oxygen into the blood stream and for removing the deoxygenated red blood cells for return to the heart and lungs for reoxygenation.\", \"2.
