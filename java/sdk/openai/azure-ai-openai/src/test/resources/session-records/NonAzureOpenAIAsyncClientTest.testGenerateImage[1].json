Elements to consider include the swirls characteristic of 'Starry Night', the expressive use of colors and textures common in his works, and the post-impressionist approach to replicating reality. The image should capture notable landmarks such as the Space Needle and the silhouette of Mount Rainier. Include a cloudy sky above, possibly with a hint of starlight breaking through the clouds, and below, the reflective waters of Puget Sound.",
