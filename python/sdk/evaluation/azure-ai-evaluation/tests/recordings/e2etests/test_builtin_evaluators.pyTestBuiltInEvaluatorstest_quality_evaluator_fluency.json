It contains pervasive grammatical errors, extremely limited vocabulary, and fragmented or incoherent sentences.

Sentences are short and may be improperly constructed, leading to partial understanding. Repetition and awkward phrasing are common.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** I like play soccer.

It is coherent, cohesive, and engaging, with precise and nuanced expression.
