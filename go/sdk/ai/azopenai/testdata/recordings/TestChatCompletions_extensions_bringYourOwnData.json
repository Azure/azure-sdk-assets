It's OK if it still needs a few updates, but expectations on pending PRs should be that they'll wrap up within a business day or two. This is what's tracked in our sprints.\n<strong>Release</strong> or <strong>\"release by\"</strong>: This is roughly the \"P95\" estimate for the latest the publicly-available release packages are published and available under the assumption that the corresponding PR complete date holds. This is an estimate that's intended to be conservative -- most releases happen before the projected date, but <strong>release is always gated by readiness</strong> and it's possible for things to get postponed. Estimated release dates may be communicated to customers, but only with the clarification that it's a target and not a guarantee.\n\n<p>The single \"source of truth\" for the SDK's \"PR complete\" date is the sprint definition on Azure DevOps: <a href=\"https://msasg.visualstudio.com/Skyman/_sprints/taskboard/Carbon%20Team/Skyman/Carbon/\">https://msasg.visualstudio.com/Skyman/_sprints/taskboard/Carbon%20Team/Skyman/Carbon/</a></p>\n<p>See the sprint date range definition in the upper right, e.g.:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.microsoft.ghe.com/user/5475/files/00c74e6f-de09-45dc-ae56-2954ee12006d\"/></p>\n<p>\"Release by\" dates, meanwhile, are generally estimated at about two weeks past PR complete -- time enough for in-flight PRs to wrap up, release candidates to be built and validated across all languages/environments, documentation and other external repository resources to be staged, and bits to be published.</p>\n<p>The dates here are replicated for convenience and history. This may not always be entirely up to date; please check the sprint board above or contact the team (cdev) if anything's unclear!</p>\n<h3>Release planning</h3>\n<p><a href=\"./planning.md\">SDK planning -- Wiki</a></p>\n<h3>Release signoff</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Carbon2/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FCarbon2%2FSiteAssets%2FCarbon%20Notebook&amp;wd=target%28Release.one%7C47758B05-9653-4BA3-B15F-0737A0AB5880%2F%29\">SDK release process -- OneNote</a></p>",
