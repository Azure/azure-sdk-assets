              "content": "There are several ways to cook a bell pepper:\n\n1. Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut the bell peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for about 25-30 minutes, or until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n2. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cut the bell peppers in half, remove the seeds and brush them with olive oil. Place them on the grill, skin side down, and cook for about 10-15 minutes, or until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n3. Sautéing: Cut the bell peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Heat some olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the bell peppers and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are soft and slightly caramelized.\n\n4. Steaming: Cut the bell peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Place them in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water. Cover and steam for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are tender.\n\n5. Stuffed: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds. Fill them with a stuffing of your choice (like cooked rice, ground meat, vegetables, cheese, etc.) and place them in a baking dish. Bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until the peppers are soft and the stuffing is heated through.\n\nRemember to always wash the bell peppers thoroughly before cooking.",
