Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n2. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cut the peppers into large flat pieces, remove the seeds and brush both sides with olive oil. Grill for 4-5 minutes on each side until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n3. Saut\u00E9ing: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Heat a pan over medium heat, add some olive oil and the peppers. Saut\u00E9 for 5-7 minutes until the peppers are soft and slightly caramelized.\n\n4. Boiling: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the peppers and cook for 3-5 minutes until they are tender.\n\n5. Steaming: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Place the peppers in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water. Cover and steam for 5-7 minutes until the peppers are tender.\n\nRemember to always wash the peppers thoroughly before cooking."
