              "content": "There are several ways to cook bell peppers:\n\n1. Roasting:\n   - Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.\n   - Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and stem.\n   - Place the peppers on a baking sheet.\n   - Drizzle with oil, seasoning with salt and pepper, or any spices you like.\n   - Roast for 25-30 minutes until the skin is charred and the peppers are tender.\n\n2. Grilling:\n   - Preheat your grill on medium heat.\n   - Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and stem.\n   - Brush the peppers with oil and season.\n   - Place the peppers on the grill for 10-15 minutes until the skin is slightly blackened and the peppers are tender.\n\n3. Saut\u00E9ing:\n   - Heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan over medium heat.\n   - Slice the peppers into thin strips, removing seeds and stem.\n   - Add pepper slices to the pan, and stir occasionally.\n   - Continue cooking for 5-7 minutes until the peppers are soft and slightly browned.\n   - Season to your taste.\n\n4. Boiling:\n   - Bring a large pot of water to a boil.\n   - Cut the peppers into pieces, removing the stems and seeds.\n   - Once the water is boiling, add the peppers and cook for about 5 minutes until tender.\n   - Using a slotted spoon, remove the peppers from the water and let them drain.\n\n5. Steaming:\n   - Cut the peppers into strips or pieces, and remove the stems and seeds.\n   - Bring a pot of water to a boil and place the steamer on top.\n   - Add the bell peppers to the steamer, cover, and let cook for about 5-7 minutes until they\u0027re tender.\n   - Be careful when removing them from the steamer as they\u0027ll be hot.\n\nRemember to be careful when handling hot materials and use an oven mitt or heat resistant gloves to prevent burns."
