              "content": "There are several ways to cook a bell pepper, depending on the recipe you\u0027re following. Here are a few methods:\n\n1. Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400\u00B0F (200\u00B0C). Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for about 25-30 minutes, or until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n2. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cut the peppers into large flat pieces, remove the seeds, and brush both sides with oil. Grill for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until charred and tender.\n\n3. Saut\u00E9ing: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Heat a pan over medium heat, add some oil, then add the peppers. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly browned.\n\n4. Stuffed: Preheat your oven to 350\u00B0F (175\u00B0C). Cut off the tops of the peppers, remove the seeds. Fill the peppers with your choice of stuffing (like cooked rice, meat, vegetables, and cheese). Place them in a baking dish, cover with foil, and bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the stuffing is heated through.\n\nRemember to wash the peppers thoroughly before cooking."
