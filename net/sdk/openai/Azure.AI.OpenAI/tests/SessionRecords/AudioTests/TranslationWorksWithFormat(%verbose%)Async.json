        "text": "Whisper is an automatic recognition system of speech trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitasking data collected on the Internet. We establish that the use of data of such a number and such a diversity is the reason why the system is able to understand many accents, despite background noise, to understand technical vocabulary, and to succeed in translation from various languages into English. As a free software, we distribute the source code for our models and for the inference, so that they can be used as a starting point to build useful applications and to help progress research in speech processing."
