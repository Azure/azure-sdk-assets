This is because there are 3 feet in a yard, and as we mentioned earlier, there are 5280 feet in a mile. Therefore:\n\n1 mile = 1760 yards\n\nSo, if you want to know how many yards are in a certain number of miles, just multiply the number of miles by 1760. For example, 2 miles would be:\n\n2 miles \\* 1760 yards/mile = 3520 yards",
