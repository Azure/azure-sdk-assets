              "content": "To provide accurate clothing recommendations, I need to know the current weather conditions in Berlin. However, here's a general guideline based on the season:\n\n- **Winter (December to February):** Temperatures can drop below freezing. Wear a heavy coat, thermal layers, scarf, gloves, and a hat. Warm, waterproof boots are also recommended.\n\n- **Spring (March to May):** Weather can be quite variable. Wear layers that you can add or remove as needed. A light jacket or sweater, along with long pants and closed-toe shoes, is usually appropriate.\n\n- **Summer (June to August):** Temperatures can be quite warm. Light, breathable clothing like shorts, t-shirts, dresses, and sandals are ideal. Carry a light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November):** Similar to spring, the weather is variable. Layers are key. A medium jacket or sweater with long pants and closed-toe shoes is generally suitable.\n\nIf you can provide today's weather details, I can give a more precise recommendation.",
