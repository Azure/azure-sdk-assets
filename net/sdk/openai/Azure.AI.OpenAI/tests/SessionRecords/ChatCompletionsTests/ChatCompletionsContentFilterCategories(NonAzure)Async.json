              "content": "There are various ways to cook a bell pepper depending on your preference and the recipe you are following. Here are a couple of common methods:\n\n1. Roasting:\n- Preheat your oven to 400\u00B0F (200\u00B0C).\n- Wash the bell pepper and pat it dry.\n- Rub the bell pepper with some olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper to taste.\n- Place the bell pepper directly on the oven rack or on a baking sheet.\n- Roast for about 25-30 minutes until the skin is blistered and lightly charred, turning occasionally.\n- Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.\n- Once it\u0027s cool enough to handle, peel off the skin, remove the seeds and stem, and slice or chop the pepper as desired.\n\n2. Saut\u00E9ing:\n- Wash the bell pepper, remove the stem and seeds, and cut it into desired-sized pieces (slices, strips, or cubes).\n- Heat a frying pan or skillet over medium heat and add some cooking oil or butter.\n- Add the bell pepper pieces to the pan and saut\u00E9 for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally until they become tender-crisp.\n- Season with salt, pepper, and any additional desired spices or herbs.\n- Continue saut\u00E9ing for another 2-3 minutes until cooked to your desired level.\n\nRemember, cooked bell peppers can be served as a side dish, added to stir-fries, used as a topping on pizzas or sandwiches, or incorporated into various recipes like stuffed peppers or sauces."
