Second, lay the tortilla flat and add the ingredients while leaving space around the edges. Finally, fold the ends in and roll tightly to secure everything. This way, it should stay closed and be delicious to eat!"

                "text": "Here's a simple, step‐by‐step method to fold a burrito that helps keep all the ingredients neatly wrapped:\n\n1. Warm Up the Tortilla\n• Use a large (10–12 inch) burrito tortilla.\n• Warm it slightly in a skillet or microwave so it’s pliable and less likely to tear.\n\n2. Layer Your Filling\n• Lay the tortilla on a flat surface with the seam down.\n• Spoon your fillings (rice, beans, meat, veggies, cheese, etc.) in a line or slightly off-center.\n• Leave about 1 ½–2 inches of space along the edges; this ensures you have room to fold without spilling.\n\n3. Fold the Bottom Edge\n• Pick up the bottom edge closest to you.\n• Fold it up so it covers the filling just a little bit. This creates a “lid” that will help secure the internal ingredients.\n\n4. Fold in the Sides\n• Fold both left and right edges toward the center. They should come in over the filling, tucking it in neatly.\n• Make sure the sides overlap slightly or snugly press against the filling. This step is crucial as it helps minimize spillage during the roll.\n\n5. Roll Up Tightly\n• With the bottom folded and the sides tucked, start rolling the burrito away from you (from the bottom edge upward).\n• Keep the roll tight by gently but firmly compressing the filling as you go.\n• Continue rolling until the entire burrito is wrapped, with the seam or the final fold at the bottom, which helps secure it.\n\nAdditional Tips:\n• Avoid overfilling. A burrito that’s too stuffed is harder to fold and tends to fall apart.\n• If your fillings are a bit bulky, consider layering heavier items (like meats or rice) first, and then add lighter, looser ingredients. This can help maintain a balanced roll.\n• If you want extra security, you can briefly toast the rolled burrito in a warm pan or grill press. This not only heats the fillings further but also helps “seal” the tortilla edges.\n\nUsing this method should give you a compact, well-wrapped burrito that’s easy to hold and enjoy without losing any of those tasty fillings. Enjoy your meal!"
