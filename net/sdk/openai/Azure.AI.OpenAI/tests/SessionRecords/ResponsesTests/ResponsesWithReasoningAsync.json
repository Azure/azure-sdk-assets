The typical method involves a left/right fold technique. First, I'll lay the tortilla flat and recommend using a warm flour tortilla to keep it flexible. Then, I'll add the ingredients, leaving space near the edges. The steps are simple: fold the bottom edge over the filling, then fold in the sides, and finally roll it up. There are alternative techniques too, like anchoring the grain first."

                "text": "Folding a burrito so that it stays closed and doesn’t spill its filling can seem tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it’s straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step method often considered one of the best ways:\n\n1. Warm Your Tortilla:\n\u2003• Use a large, pliable flour tortilla (10–12 inches in diameter).\n\u2003• Quickly heat it on a dry skillet or in the microwave. This makes it more flexible and less likely to crack when you roll it.\n\n2. Place the Filling Strategically:\n\u2003• Lay the tortilla flat on a clean surface.\n\u2003• Spoon your fillings (rice, beans, meat, veggies, cheese, etc.) down the center. Make sure you leave about 2 inches of space on all sides. Keeping the filling centered helps in creating a good seal.\n\u2003• If you have wet ingredients like salsa or sour cream, consider placing them in the middle rather than at the edges to avoid creating soggy spots that might cause the wrap to break open.\n\n3. Start With the Bottom Edge:\n\u2003• Pick the side closest to you (the “bottom”) and fold it upward over the filling. This initial tuck gives you a base to hold the fillings in place.\n\u2003• Press gently so the filling nestles into the folded portion.\n\n4. Fold In the Sides:\n\u2003• Next, take the left and right edges and fold them inwards over the bottom fold. Even if a little filling sticks out, the final roll should fully enclose it.\n\u2003• Folding the sides helps secure the inner contents and prevents them from leaking out.\n\n5. Roll to Seal:\n\u2003• With the sides tucked in, roll the burrito away from you, starting at the edge that’s closest to you.\n\u2003• Roll tightly—firmly but not so hard that you crush the filling—until the burrito is completely wrapped.\n\u2003• If you’re worried about the seam coming undone, you can place the burrito seam-down on a warm surface for a minute; this helps “set” the fold.\n\nTips for Success:\n\u2003• Don’t over-fill your burrito; too much filling can make rolling and sealing difficult.\n\u2003• Adjust the positioning of fillings if needed; place heavier ingredients in the center where they help keep the burrito stable.\n\u2003• Practice makes perfect—if your first few burritos open up, a little adjustment with the amount and distribution of ingredients can help.\n\nThis technique should give you a tightly folded burrito that’s easy to eat and holds together whether you’re on the go or sitting down. Happy rolling!"
