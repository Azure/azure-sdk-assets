              "content": "To provide a precise answer, I would need to know the weather conditions in Berlin today. However, I can give general advice based on the time of year:\n\n- **Spring (March to May):** Layered clothing is ideal as temperatures can vary widely. A light jacket or sweater, along with a t-shirt, should work well. Don't forget an umbrella or raincoat, as spring showers are common.\n\n- **Summer (June to August):** Light clothing such as t-shirts, shorts, and dresses are suitable. It can get quite warm, so sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen are also recommended. Occasionally, it might be cooler in the evenings, so a light jacket could be useful.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November):** Layers are again useful here. Temperatures can be quite cool, so sweaters, long-sleeved shirts, and a good jacket are advisable. It can be rainy, so waterproof clothing or an umbrella is helpful.\n\n- **Winter (December to February):** Warm clothing is essential. This includes a heavy coat, sweaters, long pants, gloves, scarves, and hats. It can snow or be icy, so waterproof boots with good traction are also a good idea.\n\nTo get the most accurate recommendations, it’s best to check a reliable weather forecasting service for today’s specific conditions in Berlin.",
