Spend some time with him every day talking to him, offering him treats and playing games. Once your bird trusts ye, ye can begin training him to respond to commands.\n\nThe most effective training technique is positive reinforcement. When yer parrot does something you want him to do, reward him with a treat or a favorite toy. This will encourage him to repeat the behavior.\n\nYou can also use a clicker when training yer bird. Click the clicker when he does what you want him to do, and then reward him immediately. This will help him associate the sound of the click with a reward.\n\nRemember, training a parrot takes patience and consistency. Don\u0027t expect overnight results, and don\u0027t get discouraged if your bird doesn\u0027t respond right away. Keep at it, and soon ye and yer feathered friend will be communicating like two salty sea dogs!"
