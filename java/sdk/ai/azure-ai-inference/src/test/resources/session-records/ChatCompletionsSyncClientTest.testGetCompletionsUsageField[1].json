              "content": "To provide the most accurate clothing recommendation for your day in Berlin, I need to know the current weather conditions or forecast. If you can share the temperature, weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.), and any particular activities you have planned, I can give you a more tailored suggestion.\n\nHowever, if you don't have that information right now, a general advice for dressing in Berlin includes:\n\n1. **Fall/Spring**: Layering is key. Wear a light to medium jacket, like a denim or leather jacket, with layers underneath (such as a t-shirt and a sweater). Bring an umbrella or raincoat if there's a chance of rain.\n\n2. **Winter**: Wear a warm coat, such as a parka or wool coat, along with a hat, gloves, and a scarf. Thermal wear can be useful for under layers, especially if you'll be outside for long periods.\n\n3. **Summer**: Light clothing like t-shirts, shorts, or dresses is typical. Since evenings can sometimes be cool, bringing a light sweater or jacket can be a good idea.\n\nRemember also to choose comfortable shoes, especially if you plan on doing a lot of walking, as Berlin is a very walkable city.",
