Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until the skin is blistered and slightly blackened. \n\n2. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cut the peppers into large flat pieces, remove the seeds and brush both sides with olive oil. Grill for 4-5 minutes on each side until charred and tender.\n\n3. Saut\u00E9ing: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Heat a pan over medium heat, add some oil and then add the peppers. Saut\u00E9 for 5-7 minutes until they are tender and slightly browned.\n\n4. Boiling: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the peppers and cook for 3-5 minutes until they are tender.\n\n5. Stuffed: Preheat your oven to 350\u00B0F (175\u00B0C). Cut off the tops of the peppers, remove the seeds. Fill the peppers with a stuffing of your choice (like cooked rice, meat, vegetables, cheese), place them in a baking dish and bake for 30-40 minutes until the peppers are tender and the stuffing is heated through.\n\nRemember to always wash the peppers thoroughly before cooking."
