It's important to place heavier contents inside, with a warm tortilla for pliability. \n\nThe process involves laying the filling centrally while leaving a border, with moist ingredients in the center and drier ingredients on the sides. I should remind to not overfill. Then, you'll fold the bottom over the filling, tuck in the sides, and roll it up tightly until it's closed."

Then, fold the bottom tip up about half an inch. Next, fold in both sides to secure the filling, gently pressing down. Finally, start rolling upward until the burrito is fully sealed. It's important to keep your hands steady, avoid overfilling, and maintain that bottom fold to keep everything in place."

                "text": "There’s a tried‐and‐true method that many home cooks and professionals use to get a perfectly wrapped burrito every time. Here’s a step‐by‐step guide:\n\n1. Warm Your Tortilla:  \n   Start with a large flour tortilla warmed either in a skillet, the microwave, or on a griddle. Warming makes it more pliable and less likely to tear during the folding process.\n\n2. Arrange Your Fillings:  \n   Lay the tortilla flat on a clean surface. Spoon your fillings (rice, beans, meats, veggies, etc.) into a neat line across the center of the tortilla, leaving about 2 inches of space from the edges. Avoid overfilling, as a manageable amount is key to a tidy wrap.\n\n3. Fold the Bottom:  \n   Grab the bottom edge (the one closest to you) and lift it up over the filling. This initial fold forms the base of your burrito, holding the ingredients in place.\n\n4. Tuck in the Sides:  \n   Next, fold in both left and right edges toward the center. This helps keep your fillings contained, especially any loose ingredients and sauces. You should now see a little envelope shape with the filling snugly inside.\n\n5. Roll to Seal:  \n   With the sides tucked, begin rolling the burrito away from you (upward) while keeping the tucked sides in place. Continue rolling until the tortilla fully encases the filling. As you roll, apply steady pressure to ensure a tight wrap without bursting open.\n\n6. Optional – Seal or Toast:  \n   Once rolled, you can set your burrito seam-side down to “seal” it. Some like to toast the burrito in a skillet for a minute or two per side, which not only crisps the tortilla but also ensures that it holds its shape.\n\nKeep in mind that practice is key—if your first few attempts aren’t perfect, adjust the placement or amount of your fillings until you find the balance that works best for you. Enjoy your burrito!"
