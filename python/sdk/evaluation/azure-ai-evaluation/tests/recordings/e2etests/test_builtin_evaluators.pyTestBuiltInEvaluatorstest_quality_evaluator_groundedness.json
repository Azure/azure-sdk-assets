Read the passage of information thoroughly and select the correct answer from the three answer labels. Read the CONTEXT thoroughly to ensure you know what the CONTEXT entails. Note the ANSWER is generated by a computer system, it can contain certain symbols, which should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.\nIndependent Examples:\n## Example Task #1 Input:\n{\"CONTEXT\": \"Some are reported as not having been wanted at all.\", \"QUESTION\": \"\", \"ANSWER\": \"All are reported as being completely and fully wanted.\"}\n## Example Task #1 Output:\n1\n## Example Task #2 Input:\n{\"CONTEXT\": \"Ten new television shows appeared during the month of September.
