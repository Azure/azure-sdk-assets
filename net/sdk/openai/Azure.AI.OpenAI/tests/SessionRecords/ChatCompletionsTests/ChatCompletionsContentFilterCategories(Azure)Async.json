              "content": "Cooking a bell pepper can be done in various ways and styles. Here are some styles you can opt for:\n\n1. Roasting:\n- Preheat the oven to 450\u00B0F (232\u00B0C).\n- Slice the peppers in half lengthwise and remove the stems, seeds, and membranes.\n- Rub a little oil over the peppers and place them on a baking sheet.\n- Roast in the oven for about 25-30 minutes or until the skins are wrinkly and somewhat blackened.\n- Remove from the oven and place peppers in a bowl, cover with a plastic wrap to steam for about 10 minutes.\n- Once they\u0027re cool enough to handle, remove the skins. \n\n2. Grilling:\n- Preheat your grill to medium heat.\n- Cut the peppers into large flat pieces, remove the seeds and stem.\n- Brush both sides of the peppers with oil.\n- Place them skin side down on the grill.\n- Grill for about 8-10 minutes, flipping once, until charred and tender.\n  \n3. Sauteing:\n- Cut the bell peppers into slices or dices, removing the stem and seeds.\n- Heat some oil in a frying pan over medium heat.\n- Add the peppers and cook, stirring occasionally until they are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n4. Stir-Frying:\n- Slice the bell pepper and discard the seeds and the core.\n- Heat oil in a wok or a frying pan over high heat.\n- Add the pepper slices and stir fry for 3-4 minutes until they\u0027re just tender. \n\n5. You can also stuff bell peppers with a variety of ingredients like rice, cheese, meat, vegetables, etc. Bake stuffed peppers at 375\u00B0F (190\u00B0C) for about 30-40 minutes until peppers are tender and the stuffing is heated through.\n\nRemember: The cooking time can vary depending on how tender or crunchy you prefer your bell peppers. It\u0027s always better to test your pepper while cooking."
