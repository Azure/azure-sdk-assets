The city with its towering skyscrapers and the iconic Space Needle are captured under radiant, undulating skies, colors and forms heightened and exaggerated as a homage to the famous 'Starry Night'. The image should feature a balance between the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest and the urban jungle that is the city of Seattle. Have the medium for this piece mimic the oil on canvas texture used by Van Gogh.",
