              "content": "To give you the best advice on what to wear in Berlin today, I'd need to know the current weather conditions. Typically, Berlin's weather can vary greatly depending on the season. However, here are some general guidelines for each season:\n\n- **Spring (March to May)**: The weather can be quite variable. Layers are key. You might wear a light jacket, a sweater, and be prepared for both rain and sunshine. \n\n- **Summer (June to August)**: Berlin summers can be warm, so light, breathable clothing is best. T-shirts, shorts, or light dresses work well, but it's a good idea to bring a light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November)**: Similar to spring, autumn can be changeable. Layers are important. Consider a warm sweater, a medium-weight jacket, and be prepared for wet weather with waterproof shoes and an umbrella.\n\n- **Winter (December to February)**: Winter in Berlin can be quite cold, so you'll want to dress warmly. A heavy coat, scarves, gloves, hats, and warm boots are essential. Layering with thermal wear underneath can also be very effective.\n\nFor the most accurate advice, please check a reliable weather service for today's forecast in Berlin and dress accordingly!",
