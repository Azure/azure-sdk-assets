              "content": "1. Wash the bell peppers: Make sure to thoroughly wash the bell peppers under running water.\n\n2. Cut the peppers: Cut off the tops of the peppers and remove the seeds inside. You can also cut the pepper into slices or chunks based on your recipe\u0027s requirement.\n\n3. Choose a cooking method: There are several ways to cook bell peppers. They can be stir-fried, grilled, baked, roasted, or stuffed:\n\n   - Stir-frying: Heat a pan with some oil. Add the bell pepper slices or chunks and stir-fry them over medium heat until they are slightly soft or to your preferred texture. Season with salt and pepper or any other seasoning you like. This process usually takes around 8 to 10 minutes.\n\n   - Grilling: Preheat your grill. Put whole peppers or pepper pieces on the grill and let them cook for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until they\u0027re charred and softened. Don\u0027t forget to turn them occasionally for even cooking.\n \n   - Baking/Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400\u00B0F (200\u00B0C). Place the pepper slices or whole peppers on a baking sheet and drizzle with a little oil, salt, and pepper. Bake for 20-25 minutes (for slices) or 30-40 minutes (for whole peppers), or until they\u0027re softened and slightly charred.\n   \n   - Stuffing: Cut off the tops of the peppers and remove the seeds. Prepare a stuffing with ingredients like rice, meat, cheese, veggies, etc. Fill the peppers with the stuffing and bake in a preheated oven at 350\u00B0F (175\u00B0C) for 30-40 minutes, until the peppers are tender and the stuffing is cooked through.\n\n4. Serve: You can serve cooked bell peppers as a side dish, add them to salads, sandwiches, pizzas, or use them in other recipes. \n\nRemember, the timing can vary depending on the size of the pepper pieces and the intensity of heat, so keep an eye on them while cooking.",
