              "content": "There are several ways you can cook a bell pepper. Here are a few methods:\n\n1. Saut\u00E9ed Peppers: \n- Cut the peppers into thin slices or chunks. \n- Heat a little bit of oil or butter in a pan over medium heat. \n- Add the peppers and cook, stirring occasionally until they are softened and starting to brown.\n\n2. Roasted Peppers: \n- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\n- Cut the peppers into large pieces and remove the seeds.\n- Place the peppers on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.\n- Roast peppers in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until the skin is wrinkly and slightly charred. \n\n3. Stuffed Peppers: \n- Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\n- Cut the top off the pepper and remove the seeds inside.\n- Fill the peppers with a stuffing of your choice (e.g., cooked ground beef or turkey, chopped vegetables, and cooked rice or other grains).\n- Place the stuffed peppers in a baking dish, cover with foil and bake for 1 hour. Uncover and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the peppers are tender and the stuffing is heated through.\n\n4. Grilled or broiled Peppers:\n- Cut the peppers into large pieces, remove inner seeds and ribs.\n- Brush both sides with some oil.\n- Place the peppers on a hot grill or under a broiler. Keep an eye on them, as they cook quickly and can burn. Flip them over when they\u0027re charred.\n- Cook until skin is blackened and blistered but not ash white.\n\n  Always let the peppers cool before you handle them if you\u0027re peeling the skin off."
