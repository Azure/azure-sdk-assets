Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom azureml.core import Model\n\nmodel_path = './outputs/my_model.pkl'\nmodel = Model.register(workspace=ws, model_path=model_path, model_name='my_model')\n```\n\nThis code registers the model file located at `model_path` to the Azure Machine Learning service workspace with the name `my_model`. \n\nAnother way to log a model is to save it as an output of a `Run`. If your model generation code is part of a script or Jupyter notebook that runs as an Azure Machine Learning experiment, you can save the model file as an output of the `Run` object.

The `Experiment` constructor creates an Experiment object that is associated with your workspace, and the `start_logging()` method creates a new Run object that is associated with the Experiment. Now you can use the `run` object to log metrics, upload files, and track other information related to your machine learning experiment.",
