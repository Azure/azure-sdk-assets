                "text": "Catastrophic forgetting, also known as catastrophic interference, is a phenomenon observed in neural networks and machine learning models, particularly in the context of sequential learning tasks. It occurs when a model that is trained on a new task or dataset experiences a significant deterioration in its performance on previously learned tasks. This happens because the model's updates, optimized for the new task, overwrite or interfere with the knowledge acquired from earlier tasks.\n\nHere are some key points to understand about catastrophic forgetting:\n\n1. **Sequential Learning**: Involves training a model in a sequence of tasks. Ideally, the model should retain the knowledge from earlier tasks while acquiring new information from subsequent tasks.\n\n2. **Interference**: As the model adjusts its weights to accommodate new information, it may inadvertently disrupt the patterns or knowledge learned from previous tasks, leading to a loss of accuracy or performance on those tasks.\n\n3. **Biological Contrast**: While catastrophic forgetting is a major issue in artificial neural networks, biological brains generally do not suffer from this problem to the same extent, suggesting differences in learning and memory processes.\n\n4. **Mitigation Techniques**:\n   - **Regularization**: Techniques like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) add penalties for altering important weights.\n   - **Memory Replay**: Involves storing some examples from previous tasks and periodically retraining the model on them.\n   - **Progressive Networks**: Use different sub-networks for different tasks but share some information between them.\n   - **Continual Learning Frameworks**: Designed specifically to handle sequential tasks and minimize forgetting.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing catastrophic forgetting is crucial for developing machine learning models that can learn incrementally and robustly across a wide range of tasks."
