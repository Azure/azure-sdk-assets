It contains pervasive grammatical errors, extremely limited vocabulary, and fragmented or incoherent sentences.

Good cheese eat.\n\n## [Fluency: 2] (Basic Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response communicates simple ideas but has frequent grammatical errors and limited vocabulary. Sentences are short and may be improperly constructed, leading to partial understanding. Repetition and awkward phrasing are common.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** I like play soccer. I watch movie. It fun.\n\n  **Response:** My town small. Many people.

It is coherent, cohesive, and engaging, with precise and nuanced expression. Grammar is flawless, and the text reflects a high level of eloquence and style.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** Globalization exerts a profound influence on cultural diversity by facilitating unprecedented cultural exchange while simultaneously risking the homogenization of distinct cultural identities, which can diminish the richness of global heritage.\n\n  **Response:** Technology revolutionizes modern education by providing interactive learning platforms, enabling personalized learning experiences, and connecting students worldwide, thereby transforming how knowledge is acquired and shared.\n\n\n# Data\nRESPONSE: The capital of Japan is Tokyo.\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE based on the Definitions above.

The text is coherent, and the message is easily understood with minimal effort.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** I'm planning to visit friends and maybe see a movie together.\n\n  **Response:** I try to eat healthy food and exercise regularly by jogging.\n\n## [Fluency: 4] (Proficient Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response is well-articulated with good control of grammar and a varied vocabulary. Sentences are complex and well-structured, demonstrating coherence and cohesion. Minor errors may occur but do not affect overall understanding. The text flows smoothly, and ideas are connected logically.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** My interest in mathematics and problem-solving inspired me to become an engineer, as I enjoy designing solutions that improve people's lives.\n\n  **Response:** Environmental conservation is crucial because it protects ecosystems, preserves biodiversity, and ensures natural resources are available for future generations.\n\n## [Fluency: 5] (Exceptional Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response demonstrates an exceptional command of language with sophisticated vocabulary and complex, varied sentence structures. It is coherent, cohesive, and engaging, with precise and nuanced expression. Grammar is flawless, and the text reflects a high level of eloquence and style.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** Globalization exerts a profound influence on cultural diversity by facilitating unprecedented cultural exchange while simultaneously risking the homogenization of distinct cultural identities, which can diminish the richness of global heritage.\n\n  **Response:** Technology revolutionizes modern education by providing interactive learning platforms, enabling personalized learning experiences, and connecting students worldwide, thereby transforming how knowledge is acquired and shared.\n\n\n# Data\nRESPONSE: Honolulu\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE based on the Definitions above.
