I should give step-by-step instructions for folding it. First, I'd say to lay the tortilla on a flat surface. Then, fold in both ends and roll it tightly. There are various techniques, like the \"burrito blanket\" method or the \"tucking in the ends\" method. Ultimately, I might mention that there's no single perfect technique, just effective approaches."

Then place the filling just under the center to leave room on the edges. Next, I'll lift the bottom edge over the filling, fold in the sides, and tightly roll from the bottom. It's essential to tuck in the filling as I go. I might also mention that some prefer starting from the sides, but I'll present the most popular method for simplicity."

Then, I use my other hand to fold the sides in so everything is enclosed. Finally, I continue rolling until it forms a firm, compact shape. I suggest serving it seam-side down to keep it closed. There isn’t one perfect technique, but it’s essential to keep the burrito tightly wrapped, avoid overfilling, and use warm tortillas for easier rolling."

                "text": "There’s no one “right” way since burritos can vary by style and filling, but many cooks swear by this classic method to ensure your burrito stays neat and doesn’t spill:\n\n1. Warm Your Tortilla: Start by gently heating your large flour tortilla (about 10–12 inches) in a skillet or microwave. A warmed tortilla is pliable and less likely to tear.\n\n2. Arrange the Filling: Lay the tortilla flat on a clean surface with the seam side down. Place your ingredients (rice, beans, meat, veggies, cheese, salsa, etc.) in a horizontal line near the middle–or slightly lower than center. Leave about 2 inches of “free” space at the top, bottom, and ends so you can fold without overfilling.\n\n3. Fold the Bottom: With your fingers, lift the bottom edge of the tortilla and fold it upward over the fillings. Do it snugly so that a portion of the ingredients is enclosed.\n\n4. Tuck in the Sides: Next, fold both left and right sides inward. This step “confines” the filling and helps prevent spilling as you roll.\n\n5. Roll It Up: With the sides tucked in, continue rolling the burrito tightly from the bottom (the folded edge) toward the top. Keeping firm pressure while you roll ensures the filling stays compact and the burrito holds together.\n\n6. Final Adjustment: Once fully rolled, you can place the seam side down or, if you’re grilling or toasting it briefly, lightly press it on a hot skillet. This step can help the seam seal and give the whole burrito a pleasant finish.\n\nA few extra tips:\n• Don’t overfill: Less is more when it comes to neat folding.\n• Consistency: Cut any larger or chunkier ingredients into bite-sized pieces so that they distribute evenly.\n• Practice makes perfect: With each burrito, you can adjust the way you arrange fillings and fold to suit your taste and style.\n\nThis method is a proven favorite for many burrito aficionados. Enjoy experimenting until you discover your perfect burrito fold!"
