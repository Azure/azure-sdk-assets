This is because there are 3 feet in a yard, and as we've previously determined, there are 5,280 feet in a mile. So, to find the number of yards in a mile, divide the number of feet by the number of feet in a yard:\n\n5,280 feet รท 3 feet/yard = 1,760 yards\n\nYou can use this information for various conversions involving miles and yards, or I can help with other units if you'd like.",
