It may explain the significance, implications, or provide minor inferences that enhance understanding.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What type of food does the new restaurant offer?\n  **Response:** The new restaurant offers Italian cuisine, featuring dishes like pasta, pizza, and risotto, aiming to provide customers with an authentic Italian dining experience.\n\n  **Query:** What topics will the conference cover?\n  **Response:** The conference will cover renewable energy, climate change, and sustainability practices, bringing together global experts to discuss these critical issues. \n\n\n\n# Data\nQUERY: What is the capital of Hawaii?\nRESPONSE: Honolulu\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above. Your output should include the following information:\n- **ThoughtChain**: To improve the reasoning process, think step by step and include a step-by-step explanation of your thought process as you analyze the data based on the definitions. Keep it brief and start your ThoughtChain with \"Let's think step by step:\".\n- **Explanation**: a very short explanation of why you think the input Data should get that Score.\n- **Score**: based on your previous analysis, provide your Score. The Score you give MUST be a integer score (i.e., \"1\", \"2\"...) based on the levels of the definitions.\n\n\n## Please provide your answers between the tags: <S0>your chain of thoughts</S0>, <S1>your explanation</S1>, <S2>your Score</S2>.\n# Output"
