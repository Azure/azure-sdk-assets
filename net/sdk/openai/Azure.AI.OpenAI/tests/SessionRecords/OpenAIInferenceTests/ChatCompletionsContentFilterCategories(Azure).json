              "content": "1. Wash the bell pepper: Wash under running water. If the pepper has wax on it from the grocery store, use a vegetable wash to remove it. \n\n2. Cut the bell pepper: Cut off the top of the pepper and remove the seeds and ribs on the inside.\n\n3. Choose your cooking method:\n\n   - Sauteeing: Cut the pepper into thin slices or small pieces. Heat a little olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the peppers and cook until they are as soft as you like them -- usually around 5-7 minutes.\n\n   - Roasting: Cut the pepper into large pieces. Toss with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread out on a baking sheet and roast at 450 degrees F for about 25-30 minutes, until the edges are charred.\n\n   - Grilling: You can grill whole peppers, halves, or pieces. For whole peppers, just put them directly on the grill over medium-high heat. Rotate every few minutes until the skin is charred all over. For halves or pieces, thread onto skewers or put in a grilling basket. \n\n   - Steaming: Cut the pepper into slices or pieces. Place in a steamer basket over simmering water. Cover and steam for about 5-7 minutes, until softened.\n\n4. Season to taste: Regardless of how you cook your bell peppers, always remember to season to taste with salt and pepper, or other seasonings of your choice.\n\nNote: If you are roasting or grilling the peppers and want a smoky flavor, you can leave the charred skin on. If you want a sweeter flavor, remove the skin after cooking. This is easiest to do when the pepper is still warm. Just rub the skin off with a towel or your fingers."
