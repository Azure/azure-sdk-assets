Parrots are highly intelligent creatures, and they require a lot of love, attention, and respect to be trained properly. Ye can begin by offering yer parrot a variety of toys, including puzzle toys that will stimulate their mind and keep them engaged. Ye can also teach them to mimic certain words and phrases by repetitively saying them in a positive tone. Remember to always use positive reinforcement, and never use physical punishment with yer feathered friend. With time and effort, ye\u0027ll have a smart and well-trained parrot!"
