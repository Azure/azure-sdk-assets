This is another standard conversion in the imperial and U.S. customary systems of measurement. Yards are a larger unit than feet, so there are fewer yards in a mile compared to feet.\n\nJust to give you some context, 1 yard is equal to 3 feet. So, if you want to convert a distance given in yards to feet, you can simply multiply the number of yards by 3. Similarly, to convert a distance given in feet to yards, you can divide the number of feet by 3.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
