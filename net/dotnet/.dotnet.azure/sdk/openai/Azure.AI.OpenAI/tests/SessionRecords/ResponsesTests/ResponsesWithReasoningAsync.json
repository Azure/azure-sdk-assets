Tuck in one side, then fold the edges over the filling. The next step is to lift the bottom of the tortilla and roll it tightly from the bottom up. If the burrito has wet ingredients, I can suggest wrapping it in foil for easier handling. Simple and tasty!"

Then, place it on a flat surface and add your ingredients in a line, leaving a margin on all sides. \n\nNext, fold the bottom edge over the filling, followed by folding the left and right edges toward the center. Finally, roll from the bottom up to create a tight wrap. If it's a large burrito, hold the sides while rolling to prevent spillage. Simple and delicious!"

                "text": "There’s a bit of technique to it, but here’s a classic, reliable method for folding a burrito:\n\n1. Warm Your Tortilla: A warmed tortilla is soft and less likely to tear. You can heat it on a dry skillet or microwave (wrapped in a damp paper towel) for about 20–30 seconds.\n\n2. Lay It Out Flat: Place the tortilla on a clean work surface, with the side you want to be on the outside (if it has one) facing down.\n\n3. Add Your Fillings in a Line:\n\u2003• Place your ingredients (beans, rice, meat, veggies, cheese, etc.) in a horizontal line across the center of the tortilla, leaving about 2 inches of space on the sides and the bottom edge. Keeping the filling toward the bottom helps with the initial tuck.\n\u2003• Try not to overfill, as that might make it harder to seal the burrito.\n\n4. Fold the Bottom Edge Up:\n\u2003• Grab the edge of the tortilla closest to you and fold it upward over the filling. This creates the “bottom” of your burrito.\n\n5. Fold in the Sides:\n\u2003• With the bottom edge tucked up, fold the left and right sides inward toward the middle. These folds help lock in the filling and contain any slipping-out bits.\n\n6. Roll It Up Tight:\n\u2003• Continue rolling forward (from the bottom edge you just folded upward) while keeping the sides tucked in. Roll firmly but gently; you want it snug enough that the fillings stay put, but not so tight that the tortilla tears.\n\u2003• As you roll, make adjustments to keep the filling centered, then finish rolling until the burrito is fully enclosed.\n\n7. Optional Final Step:\n\u2003• If your burrito has particularly loose or wet ingredients, consider wrapping it in foil. The foil not only holds it together but also allows the flavors to meld a bit if you let it rest before eating.\n\nWith practice, you’ll adjust the finish to your liking. The key is a good balance: using a flexible tortilla, leaving enough space around the fillings for proper tucking, and rolling it up tightly. Enjoy your burrito!"
