Think swirling stars and enveloping colors, like vibrant hues seen in \u0027Starry Night,\u0027 amplified to reflect modern city structures. The buildings are outlined with heavy, bold strokes, emanating an almost tactile energy. The sky murmurs with swirling clouds, yet also glows in presenting a sense of vastness and mystery. The scene is completed with the famed Space Needle, standing tall in this aesthetic mix of old and new, its silhouette noticeable against the cosmic backdrop.",
