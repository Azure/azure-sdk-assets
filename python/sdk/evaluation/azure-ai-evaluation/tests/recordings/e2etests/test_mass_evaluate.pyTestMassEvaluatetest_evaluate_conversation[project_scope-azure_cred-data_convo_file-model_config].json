Your task is to judge how relevant a RESPONSE is to a QUERY using the Relevance definitions provided.\n\nINPUT\n=====\nQUERY: What shape has 3 sides\nRESPONSE: A triangle\n\nTASK\n====\nOutput a JSON object with:\n    1) a concise explanation of 15-60 words justifying your score based on how well the response is relevant to the query.\n    2) an integer score from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent) using the rubric below.\n\nThe explanation should always precede the score and should clearly justify the score based on the rubric definitions.\nResponse format exactly as follows:\n\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"<15-60 words>\",\n  \"score\": <1-5>\n}\n\n\nEVALUATION STEPS\n================\nA. Read the QUERY and RESPONSE carefully.\nB. Compare the RESPONSE against the rubric below:\n    - Does the response directly address the query?\n    - Is the information complete, partial, or off-topic?\n    - Is it vague, generic, or insightful?\nC. Match the response to the best score from the rubric.\nD. Provide a short explanation and the score using the required format.\n\nSCORING RUBRIC\n==============\n\n### Score 1 - Irrelevant Response\nDefinition: The response is unrelated to the question. It provides off-topic information and does not attempt to address the question posed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the team preparing for?\nRESPONSE: I went grocery shopping yesterday evening.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is entirely off-topic and doesn't address the question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: When will the company's new product line launch?\nRESPONSE: International travel can be very rewarding and educational.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is completely irrelevant to the product launch question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n### Score 2 – Related but Unhelpful / Superficial\nDefinition: The response is loosely or formally related to the query but fails to deliver any meaningful, specific, or useful information. This includes vague phrases, non-answers, or failure/error messages.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the event about?\nRESPONSE: It’s something important.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response vaguely refers to the query topic but lacks specific or informative content.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What’s the weather in Paris?\nRESPONSE: I tried to find the forecast but the query failed.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response acknowledges the query but provides no usable weather information. It is related but unhelpful.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n### Score 3 - Partially Relevant / Incomplete\nDefinition: The response addresses the query and includes relevant information, but omits essential components or detail. The answer is on-topic but insufficient to fully satisfy the request.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex has a gym.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions one amenity but does not provide a fuller list or clarify whether other standard features (like parking or security) are included. It partially addresses the query but lacks completeness.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: It includes priority customer support.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response identifies one service but omits other likely components of a premium membership (e.g., exclusive content or discounts). The information is relevant but incomplete.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n\n\n### Score 4 - Fully Relevant / Sufficient Response\nDefinition: The response fully addresses the question with accurate and sufficient information, covering all essential aspects. Very minor omissions are acceptable as long as the core information is intact and the intent is clearly conveyed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions multiple key amenities likely to be relevant to most users. While it may not list every feature, it clearly conveys the core offerings of the complex.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response outlines all major services expected from a premium membership. Even if a minor service is not mentioned, the core value is clearly and fully represented.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n\n### Score 5 - Comprehensive Response with Insights\nDefinition: The response not only fully and accurately answers the question, but also adds meaningful elaboration, interpretation, or context that enhances the user's understanding. This goes beyond just listing relevant details — it offers insight into why the information matters, how it's useful, or what impact it has.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security, designed to offer residents a comfortable and active lifestyle while ensuring their safety.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response fully lists key amenities and additionally explains how these features contribute to resident experience, enhancing the usefulness of the information.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases — tailored for users who want quicker resolutions and first access to new features.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response covers all essential services and adds valuable insight about the target user and benefits, enriching the response beyond basic listing.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}"

Your task is to judge how relevant a RESPONSE is to a QUERY using the Relevance definitions provided.\n\nINPUT\n=====\nQUERY: What is the capital of Hawaii`''\"</>{}{{]\nRESPONSE: Honolulu\n\nTASK\n====\nOutput a JSON object with:\n    1) a concise explanation of 15-60 words justifying your score based on how well the response is relevant to the query.\n    2) an integer score from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent) using the rubric below.\n\nThe explanation should always precede the score and should clearly justify the score based on the rubric definitions.\nResponse format exactly as follows:\n\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"<15-60 words>\",\n  \"score\": <1-5>\n}\n\n\nEVALUATION STEPS\n================\nA. Read the QUERY and RESPONSE carefully.\nB. Compare the RESPONSE against the rubric below:\n    - Does the response directly address the query?\n    - Is the information complete, partial, or off-topic?\n    - Is it vague, generic, or insightful?\nC. Match the response to the best score from the rubric.\nD. Provide a short explanation and the score using the required format.\n\nSCORING RUBRIC\n==============\n\n### Score 1 - Irrelevant Response\nDefinition: The response is unrelated to the question. It provides off-topic information and does not attempt to address the question posed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the team preparing for?\nRESPONSE: I went grocery shopping yesterday evening.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is entirely off-topic and doesn't address the question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: When will the company's new product line launch?\nRESPONSE: International travel can be very rewarding and educational.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is completely irrelevant to the product launch question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n### Score 2 – Related but Unhelpful / Superficial\nDefinition: The response is loosely or formally related to the query but fails to deliver any meaningful, specific, or useful information. This includes vague phrases, non-answers, or failure/error messages.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the event about?\nRESPONSE: It’s something important.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response vaguely refers to the query topic but lacks specific or informative content.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What’s the weather in Paris?\nRESPONSE: I tried to find the forecast but the query failed.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response acknowledges the query but provides no usable weather information. It is related but unhelpful.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n### Score 3 - Partially Relevant / Incomplete\nDefinition: The response addresses the query and includes relevant information, but omits essential components or detail. The answer is on-topic but insufficient to fully satisfy the request.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex has a gym.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions one amenity but does not provide a fuller list or clarify whether other standard features (like parking or security) are included. It partially addresses the query but lacks completeness.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: It includes priority customer support.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response identifies one service but omits other likely components of a premium membership (e.g., exclusive content or discounts). The information is relevant but incomplete.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n\n\n### Score 4 - Fully Relevant / Sufficient Response\nDefinition: The response fully addresses the question with accurate and sufficient information, covering all essential aspects. Very minor omissions are acceptable as long as the core information is intact and the intent is clearly conveyed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions multiple key amenities likely to be relevant to most users. While it may not list every feature, it clearly conveys the core offerings of the complex.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response outlines all major services expected from a premium membership. Even if a minor service is not mentioned, the core value is clearly and fully represented.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n\n### Score 5 - Comprehensive Response with Insights\nDefinition: The response not only fully and accurately answers the question, but also adds meaningful elaboration, interpretation, or context that enhances the user's understanding. This goes beyond just listing relevant details — it offers insight into why the information matters, how it's useful, or what impact it has.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security, designed to offer residents a comfortable and active lifestyle while ensuring their safety.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response fully lists key amenities and additionally explains how these features contribute to resident experience, enhancing the usefulness of the information.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases — tailored for users who want quicker resolutions and first access to new features.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response covers all essential services and adds valuable insight about the target user and benefits, enriching the response beyond basic listing.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}"

A coherent answer directly addresses the question with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs, using appropriate transitions and a logical sequence of ideas.\n\n# Ratings\n## [Coherence: 1] (Incoherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response lacks coherence entirely. It consists of disjointed words or phrases that do not form complete or meaningful sentences. There is no logical connection to the question, making the response incomprehensible.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What are the benefits of renewable energy?\n  **Response:** Wind sun green jump apple silence over.\n\n  **Query:** Explain the process of photosynthesis.\n  **Response:** Plants light water flying blue music.\n\n## [Coherence: 2] (Poorly Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response shows minimal coherence with fragmented sentences and limited connection to the question. It contains some relevant keywords but lacks logical structure and clear relationships between ideas, making the overall message difficult to understand.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** How does vaccination work?\n  **Response:** Vaccines protect disease. Immune system fight. Health better.\n\n  **Query:** Describe how a bill becomes a law.\n  **Response:** Idea proposed. Congress discuss vote. President signs.\n\n## [Coherence: 3] (Partially Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response partially addresses the question with some relevant information but exhibits issues in the logical flow and organization of ideas. Connections between sentences may be unclear or abrupt, requiring the reader to infer the links. The response may lack smooth transitions and may present ideas out of order.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What causes earthquakes?\n  **Response:** Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates move suddenly. Energy builds up then releases. Ground shakes and can cause damage.\n\n  **Query:** Explain the importance of the water cycle.\n  **Response:** The water cycle moves water around Earth. Evaporation, then precipitation occurs. It supports life by distributing water.\n\n## [Coherence: 4] (Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is coherent and effectively addresses the question. Ideas are logically organized with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs. Appropriate transitions are used to guide the reader through the response, which flows smoothly and is easy to follow.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What is the water cycle and how does it work?\n  **Response:** The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth through processes like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water evaporates from bodies of water, forms clouds through condensation, and returns to the surface as precipitation. This cycle is essential for distributing water resources globally.\n\n  **Query:** Describe the role of mitochondria in cellular function.\n  **Response:** Mitochondria are organelles that produce energy for the cell. They convert nutrients into ATP through cellular respiration. This energy powers various cellular activities, making mitochondria vital for cell survival.\n\n## [Coherence: 5] (Highly Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is exceptionally coherent, demonstrating sophisticated organization and flow. Ideas are presented in a logical and seamless manner, with excellent use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices. The connections between concepts are clear and enhance the reader's understanding. The response thoroughly addresses the question with clarity and precision.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** Analyze the economic impacts of climate change on coastal cities.\n  **Response:** Climate change significantly affects the economies of coastal cities through rising sea levels, increased flooding, and more intense storms. These environmental changes can damage infrastructure, disrupt businesses, and lead to costly repairs. For instance, frequent flooding can hinder transportation and commerce, while the threat of severe weather may deter investment and tourism. Consequently, cities may face increased expenses for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts, straining municipal budgets and impacting economic growth.\n\n  **Query:** Discuss the significance of the Monroe Doctrine in shaping U.S. foreign policy.\n  **Response:** The Monroe Doctrine was a pivotal policy declared in 1823 that asserted U.S. opposition to European colonization in the Americas. By stating that any intervention by external powers in the Western Hemisphere would be viewed as a hostile act, it established the U.S. as a protector of the region. This doctrine shaped U.S. foreign policy by promoting isolation from European conflicts while justifying American influence and expansion in the hemisphere. Its long-term significance lies in its enduring influence on international relations and its role in defining the U.S. position in global affairs.\n\n\n# Data\nQUERY: What shape has 3 sides\nRESPONSE: A triangle\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above. Your output should include the following information:\n- **ThoughtChain**: To improve the reasoning process, think step by step and include a step-by-step explanation of your thought process as you analyze the data based on the definitions. Keep it brief and start your ThoughtChain with \"Let's think step by step:\".\n- **Explanation**: a very short explanation of why you think the input Data should get that Score.\n- **Score**: based on your previous analysis, provide your Score. The Score you give MUST be a integer score (i.e., \"1\", \"2\"...) based on the levels of the definitions.\n\n\n## Please provide your answers between the tags: <S0>your chain of thoughts</S0>, <S1>your explanation</S1>, <S2>your Score</S2>.\n# Output"

There are a number of reasons for a high monocyte count, which can also be called monocytosis. Some of the reasons can include stress, viral fevers, inflammation and organ necrosis. A physician may order a monocyte blood count test to check for raised levels of monocytes. There are a number of reasons for this test, from a simple health check up to people suffering from heart attacks and leukemia. Complications with the blood and cancer are two other reasons that this test may be performed.\", \"Monocytes are considered the largest white blood cell. These cells are part of the innate immune system. Monocytes also play important roles in the immune function of the body. These cells are often found when doing a stained smear and appear large kidney shaped. Many of these are found in the spleen area.\", \"This is taken directly from-http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-monocytes.htm#. Monocytes are a type of leukocyte or white blood cell which play a role in immune system function. Depending on a patient's level of health, monocytes make up between one and three percent of the total white blood cells in the body. For example, if monocytes are elevated because of an inflammation caused by a viral infection, the patient would be given medication to kill the virus and bring down the inflammation. Typically, when a monocyte count is requested, the lab will also run other tests on the blood to generate a complete picture.\", \"3D Rendering of a Monocyte. Monocytes are a type of white blood cells (leukocytes). They are the largest of all leukocytes. They are part of the innate immune system of vertebrates including all mammals (humans included), birds, reptiles, and fish. Monocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to other tissues will then differentiate into tissue resident macrophages or dendritic cells. Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances, but are also suspected to be important in the formation of important organs like the heart and brain.\"]\n\n  **Query:** What were the key features of the Magna Carta?\n  **Context:** [\"The Magna Carta influenced the legal system in Europe, especially in constitutional law.\", \"It was signed in 1215 by King John of England to limit the powers of the monarchy.\", \"The Magna Carta introduced principles like due process and habeas corpus, which are key features of modern legal systems.\"]\n\n## [Retrieval: 4] (Relevant Context Ranked Middle, No External Knowledge Bias and Factual Accuracy Ignored)\n**Definition:** The context chunks fully address the query, but the most relevant chunk is ranked in the middle of the list. No external knowledge is used to influence the ranking of the chunks; the system only relies on the provided context. Factual accuracy remains out of scope for evaluation.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** do game shows pay their contestants\n  **Context:** [\"So, in the end, game show winners get some of the money that TV advertisers pay to the networks, who pay the show producers, who then pay the game show winners. Just in the same way that the actors, and crew of a show get paid. Game shows, like other programs, have costs to produce the programs—they have to pay for sets, cameras, talent (the hosts), and also prizes to contestants.\", \"(Valerie Macon/Getty Images). Oh, happy day! You're a contestant on a popular game show—The Price Is Right, let's say. You spin the wheel, you make the winning bid, and suddenly—ka-ching!—you've won the Lexus or the dishwasher or the lifetime supply of nail clippers.\", \"1 If you can use most of the prizes the show offers, such as a new car or trip, you may be content to appear on a game show that features material prizes. 2 If not, you should probably try out for a show where cash is the main prize. 3 In the United States, game show contestants must pay taxes on any prizes they win. 2. Meet the eligibility requirements. All game shows have certain eligibility requirements for their contestants. Generally, you must be at least 18 years of age, except for those shows that use child or teenage contestants, and you are allowed to appear on no more than 1 game show per year.\", \"Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: You don't always win the money amount on the front of your lectern when you are on a game show. As someone else said, 2nd place earns $2000 and 3rd place earns $1000 in Jeopardy! In any case, the prize money is paid out from the ad revenue that the show receives from sponsors. I think in this case Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Deal or No Deal is the best example of how shows can be successful while still paying the prize money. I feel this way because these shows have a potential, however small it may be, to pay out 1 million dollars to every contestant on the show. Here is the reality. Regardless of the show whether it be a game show or a drama, a network will receive money from commercial advertising based on the viewership. With this in mind a game show costs very little to actually air compared to a full production drama series, that's where the prize money comes from\"]\n\n## [Retrieval: 5] (Highly Relevant, Well Ranked, No Bias Introduced)\n**Definition:** The context chunks not only fully address the query, but also surface the most relevant chunks at the top of the list. The retrieval respects the internal context, avoids relying on any outside knowledge, and focuses solely on pulling the most useful content to the forefront, irrespective of the factual correctness of the information.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** The smallest blood vessels in your body, where gas exchange occurs are called\n  **Context:** [\"Gas exchange is the delivery of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream, and the elimination of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream to the lungs. It occurs in the lungs between the alveoli and a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries, which are located in the walls of the alveoli. The walls of the alveoli actually share a membrane with the capillaries in which oxygen and carbon dioxide move freely between the respiratory system and the bloodstream.\", \"Arterioles branch into capillaries, the smallest of all blood vessels. Capillaries are the sites of nutrient and waste exchange between the blood and body cells. Capillaries are microscopic vessels that join the arterial system with the venous system.\", \"Arterioles are the smallest arteries and regulate blood flow into capillary beds through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Capillaries are the smallest vessels and allow for exchange of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid. Continuous capillaries are most common and allow passage of fluids and small solutes. Fenestrated capillaries are more permeable to fluids and solutes than continuous capillaries.\", \"Tweet. The smallest blood vessels in the human body are capillaries. They are responsible for the absorption of oxygen into the blood stream and for removing the deoxygenated red blood cells for return to the heart and lungs for reoxygenation.\", \"2. Capillaries—these are the sites of gas exchange between the tissues. 3. Veins—these return oxygen poor blood to the heart, except for the vein that carries blood from the lungs. On the right is a diagram showing how the three connect. Notice the artery and vein are much larger than the capillaries.\", \"Gas exchange occurs in the capillaries which are the smallest blood vessels in the body. Each artery that comes from the heart is surrounded by capillaries so that they can take it to the various parts of the body.\"]\n\n\n# Data\nQUERY: What shape has 3 sides\nCONTEXT: {}\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous CONTEXT in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

It contains pervasive grammatical errors, extremely limited vocabulary, and fragmented or incoherent sentences. The message is largely incomprehensible, making understanding very difficult.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** Free time I. Go park. Not fun. Alone.\n\n  **Response:** Like food pizza. Good cheese eat.\n\n## [Fluency: 2] (Basic Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response communicates simple ideas but has frequent grammatical errors and limited vocabulary. Sentences are short and may be improperly constructed, leading to partial understanding. Repetition and awkward phrasing are common.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** I like play soccer. I watch movie. It fun.\n\n  **Response:** My town small. Many people. We have market.\n\n## [Fluency: 3] (Competent Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response clearly conveys ideas with occasional grammatical errors. Vocabulary is adequate but not extensive. Sentences are generally correct but may lack complexity and variety. The text is coherent, and the message is easily understood with minimal effort.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** I'm planning to visit friends and maybe see a movie together.\n\n  **Response:** I try to eat healthy food and exercise regularly by jogging.\n\n## [Fluency: 4] (Proficient Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response is well-articulated with good control of grammar and a varied vocabulary. Sentences are complex and well-structured, demonstrating coherence and cohesion. Minor errors may occur but do not affect overall understanding. The text flows smoothly, and ideas are connected logically.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** My interest in mathematics and problem-solving inspired me to become an engineer, as I enjoy designing solutions that improve people's lives.\n\n  **Response:** Environmental conservation is crucial because it protects ecosystems, preserves biodiversity, and ensures natural resources are available for future generations.\n\n## [Fluency: 5] (Exceptional Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response demonstrates an exceptional command of language with sophisticated vocabulary and complex, varied sentence structures. It is coherent, cohesive, and engaging, with precise and nuanced expression. Grammar is flawless, and the text reflects a high level of eloquence and style.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** Globalization exerts a profound influence on cultural diversity by facilitating unprecedented cultural exchange while simultaneously risking the homogenization of distinct cultural identities, which can diminish the richness of global heritage.\n\n  **Response:** Technology revolutionizes modern education by providing interactive learning platforms, enabling personalized learning experiences, and connecting students worldwide, thereby transforming how knowledge is acquired and shared.\n\n\n# Data\nRESPONSE: Honolulu\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE based on the Definitions above.

A physician may order a monocyte blood count test to check for raised levels of monocytes. There are a number of reasons for this test, from a simple health check up to people suffering from heart attacks and leukemia. Complications with the blood and cancer are two other reasons that this test may be performed.\", \"Monocytes are considered the largest white blood cell.

No external knowledge is used to influence the ranking of the chunks; the system only relies on the provided context. Factual accuracy remains out of scope for evaluation.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** do game shows pay their contestants\n  **Context:** [\"So, in the end, game show winners get some of the money that TV advertisers pay to the networks, who pay the show producers, who then pay the game show winners. Just in the same way that the actors, and crew of a show get paid.

Meet the eligibility requirements. All game shows have certain eligibility requirements for their contestants. Generally, you must be at least 18 years of age, except for those shows that use child or teenage contestants, and you are allowed to appear on no more than 1 game show per year.\", \"Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: You don't always win the money amount on the front of your lectern when you are on a game show. As someone else said, 2nd place earns $2000 and 3rd place earns $1000 in Jeopardy! In any case, the prize money is paid out from the ad revenue that the show receives from sponsors. I think in this case Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Deal or No Deal is the best example of how shows can be successful while still paying the prize money. I feel this way because these shows have a potential, however small it may be, to pay out 1 million dollars to every contestant on the show. Here is the reality. Regardless of the show whether it be a game show or a drama, a network will receive money from commercial advertising based on the viewership. With this in mind a game show costs very little to actually air compared to a full production drama series, that's where the prize money comes from\"]\n\n## [Retrieval: 5] (Highly Relevant, Well Ranked, No Bias Introduced)\n**Definition:** The context chunks not only fully address the query, but also surface the most relevant chunks at the top of the list. The retrieval respects the internal context, avoids relying on any outside knowledge, and focuses solely on pulling the most useful content to the forefront, irrespective of the factual correctness of the information.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** The smallest blood vessels in your body, where gas exchange occurs are called\n  **Context:** [\"Gas exchange is the delivery of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream, and the elimination of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream to the lungs. It occurs in the lungs between the alveoli and a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries, which are located in the walls of the alveoli. The walls of the alveoli actually share a membrane with the capillaries in which oxygen and carbon dioxide move freely between the respiratory system and the bloodstream.\", \"Arterioles branch into capillaries, the smallest of all blood vessels. Capillaries are the sites of nutrient and waste exchange between the blood and body cells. Capillaries are microscopic vessels that join the arterial system with the venous system.\", \"Arterioles are the smallest arteries and regulate blood flow into capillary beds through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Capillaries are the smallest vessels and allow for exchange of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid. Continuous capillaries are most common and allow passage of fluids and small solutes. Fenestrated capillaries are more permeable to fluids and solutes than continuous capillaries.\", \"Tweet.

Energy builds up then releases. Ground shakes and can cause damage.\n\n  **Query:** Explain the importance of the water cycle.\n  **Response:** The water cycle moves water around Earth. Evaporation, then precipitation occurs. It supports life by distributing water.\n\n## [Coherence: 4] (Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is coherent and effectively addresses the question. Ideas are logically organized with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs. Appropriate transitions are used to guide the reader through the response, which flows smoothly and is easy to follow.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What is the water cycle and how does it work?\n  **Response:** The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth through processes like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water evaporates from bodies of water, forms clouds through condensation, and returns to the surface as precipitation. This cycle is essential for distributing water resources globally.\n\n  **Query:** Describe the role of mitochondria in cellular function.\n  **Response:** Mitochondria are organelles that produce energy for the cell. They convert nutrients into ATP through cellular respiration. This energy powers various cellular activities, making mitochondria vital for cell survival.\n\n## [Coherence: 5] (Highly Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is exceptionally coherent, demonstrating sophisticated organization and flow. Ideas are presented in a logical and seamless manner, with excellent use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices. The connections between concepts are clear and enhance the reader's understanding. The response thoroughly addresses the question with clarity and precision.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** Analyze the economic impacts of climate change on coastal cities.\n  **Response:** Climate change significantly affects the economies of coastal cities through rising sea levels, increased flooding, and more intense storms. These environmental changes can damage infrastructure, disrupt businesses, and lead to costly repairs. For instance, frequent flooding can hinder transportation and commerce, while the threat of severe weather may deter investment and tourism. Consequently, cities may face increased expenses for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts, straining municipal budgets and impacting economic growth.\n\n  **Query:** Discuss the significance of the Monroe Doctrine in shaping U.S. foreign policy.\n  **Response:** The Monroe Doctrine was a pivotal policy declared in 1823 that asserted U.S. opposition to European colonization in the Americas. By stating that any intervention by external powers in the Western Hemisphere would be viewed as a hostile act, it established the U.S. as a protector of the region. This doctrine shaped U.S. foreign policy by promoting isolation from European conflicts while justifying American influence and expansion in the hemisphere. Its long-term significance lies in its enduring influence on international relations and its role in defining the U.S. position in global affairs.\n\n\n# Data\nQUERY: What is the capital of Hawaii`''\"</>{}{{]\nRESPONSE: Honolulu\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Your task is to judge how relevant a RESPONSE is to a QUERY using the Relevance definitions provided.\n\nINPUT\n=====\nQUERY: Ok, what is the capital of Massachusetts\nRESPONSE: Boston\n\nTASK\n====\nOutput a JSON object with:\n    1) a concise explanation of 15-60 words justifying your score based on how well the response is relevant to the query.\n    2) an integer score from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent) using the rubric below.\n\nThe explanation should always precede the score and should clearly justify the score based on the rubric definitions.\nResponse format exactly as follows:\n\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"<15-60 words>\",\n  \"score\": <1-5>\n}\n\n\nEVALUATION STEPS\n================\nA. Read the QUERY and RESPONSE carefully.\nB. Compare the RESPONSE against the rubric below:\n    - Does the response directly address the query?\n    - Is the information complete, partial, or off-topic?\n    - Is it vague, generic, or insightful?\nC. Match the response to the best score from the rubric.\nD. Provide a short explanation and the score using the required format.\n\nSCORING RUBRIC\n==============\n\n### Score 1 - Irrelevant Response\nDefinition: The response is unrelated to the question. It provides off-topic information and does not attempt to address the question posed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the team preparing for?\nRESPONSE: I went grocery shopping yesterday evening.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is entirely off-topic and doesn't address the question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: When will the company's new product line launch?\nRESPONSE: International travel can be very rewarding and educational.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is completely irrelevant to the product launch question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n### Score 2 – Related but Unhelpful / Superficial\nDefinition: The response is loosely or formally related to the query but fails to deliver any meaningful, specific, or useful information. This includes vague phrases, non-answers, or failure/error messages.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the event about?\nRESPONSE: It’s something important.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response vaguely refers to the query topic but lacks specific or informative content.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What’s the weather in Paris?\nRESPONSE: I tried to find the forecast but the query failed.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response acknowledges the query but provides no usable weather information. It is related but unhelpful.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n### Score 3 - Partially Relevant / Incomplete\nDefinition: The response addresses the query and includes relevant information, but omits essential components or detail. The answer is on-topic but insufficient to fully satisfy the request.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex has a gym.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions one amenity but does not provide a fuller list or clarify whether other standard features (like parking or security) are included. It partially addresses the query but lacks completeness.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: It includes priority customer support.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response identifies one service but omits other likely components of a premium membership (e.g., exclusive content or discounts). The information is relevant but incomplete.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n\n\n### Score 4 - Fully Relevant / Sufficient Response\nDefinition: The response fully addresses the question with accurate and sufficient information, covering all essential aspects. Very minor omissions are acceptable as long as the core information is intact and the intent is clearly conveyed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions multiple key amenities likely to be relevant to most users. While it may not list every feature, it clearly conveys the core offerings of the complex.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response outlines all major services expected from a premium membership. Even if a minor service is not mentioned, the core value is clearly and fully represented.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n\n### Score 5 - Comprehensive Response with Insights\nDefinition: The response not only fully and accurately answers the question, but also adds meaningful elaboration, interpretation, or context that enhances the user's understanding. This goes beyond just listing relevant details — it offers insight into why the information matters, how it's useful, or what impact it has.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security, designed to offer residents a comfortable and active lifestyle while ensuring their safety.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response fully lists key amenities and additionally explains how these features contribute to resident experience, enhancing the usefulness of the information.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases — tailored for users who want quicker resolutions and first access to new features.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response covers all essential services and adds valuable insight about the target user and benefits, enriching the response beyond basic listing.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}"

Your task is to judge how relevant a RESPONSE is to a QUERY using the Relevance definitions provided.\n\nINPUT\n=====\nQUERY: Next, what shape has 4 sides\nRESPONSE: A square\n\nTASK\n====\nOutput a JSON object with:\n    1) a concise explanation of 15-60 words justifying your score based on how well the response is relevant to the query.\n    2) an integer score from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent) using the rubric below.\n\nThe explanation should always precede the score and should clearly justify the score based on the rubric definitions.\nResponse format exactly as follows:\n\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"<15-60 words>\",\n  \"score\": <1-5>\n}\n\n\nEVALUATION STEPS\n================\nA. Read the QUERY and RESPONSE carefully.\nB. Compare the RESPONSE against the rubric below:\n    - Does the response directly address the query?\n    - Is the information complete, partial, or off-topic?\n    - Is it vague, generic, or insightful?\nC. Match the response to the best score from the rubric.\nD. Provide a short explanation and the score using the required format.\n\nSCORING RUBRIC\n==============\n\n### Score 1 - Irrelevant Response\nDefinition: The response is unrelated to the question. It provides off-topic information and does not attempt to address the question posed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the team preparing for?\nRESPONSE: I went grocery shopping yesterday evening.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is entirely off-topic and doesn't address the question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: When will the company's new product line launch?\nRESPONSE: International travel can be very rewarding and educational.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response is completely irrelevant to the product launch question.\",\n    \"score\": 1\n}\n\n\n### Score 2 – Related but Unhelpful / Superficial\nDefinition: The response is loosely or formally related to the query but fails to deliver any meaningful, specific, or useful information. This includes vague phrases, non-answers, or failure/error messages.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What is the event about?\nRESPONSE: It’s something important.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response vaguely refers to the query topic but lacks specific or informative content.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What’s the weather in Paris?\nRESPONSE: I tried to find the forecast but the query failed.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"The response acknowledges the query but provides no usable weather information. It is related but unhelpful.\",\n  \"score\": 2\n}\n\n### Score 3 - Partially Relevant / Incomplete\nDefinition: The response addresses the query and includes relevant information, but omits essential components or detail. The answer is on-topic but insufficient to fully satisfy the request.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex has a gym.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions one amenity but does not provide a fuller list or clarify whether other standard features (like parking or security) are included. It partially addresses the query but lacks completeness.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: It includes priority customer support.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response identifies one service but omits other likely components of a premium membership (e.g., exclusive content or discounts). The information is relevant but incomplete.\",\n    \"score\": 3\n}\n\n\n\n### Score 4 - Fully Relevant / Sufficient Response\nDefinition: The response fully addresses the question with accurate and sufficient information, covering all essential aspects. Very minor omissions are acceptable as long as the core information is intact and the intent is clearly conveyed.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response mentions multiple key amenities likely to be relevant to most users. While it may not list every feature, it clearly conveys the core offerings of the complex.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response outlines all major services expected from a premium membership. Even if a minor service is not mentioned, the core value is clearly and fully represented.\",\n    \"score\": 4\n}\n\n\n### Score 5 - Comprehensive Response with Insights\nDefinition: The response not only fully and accurately answers the question, but also adds meaningful elaboration, interpretation, or context that enhances the user's understanding. This goes beyond just listing relevant details — it offers insight into why the information matters, how it's useful, or what impact it has.\n\n**Example A**\nQUERY: What amenities does the new apartment complex provide?\nRESPONSE: The apartment complex provides a gym, swimming pool, and 24/7 security, designed to offer residents a comfortable and active lifestyle while ensuring their safety.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response fully lists key amenities and additionally explains how these features contribute to resident experience, enhancing the usefulness of the information.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}\n\n**Example B**\nQUERY: What services does the premium membership include?\nRESPONSE: The premium membership includes priority customer support, exclusive content access, and early product releases — tailored for users who want quicker resolutions and first access to new features.\n\nExpected Output:\n{\n    \"explanation\": \"The response covers all essential services and adds valuable insight about the target user and benefits, enriching the response beyond basic listing.\",\n    \"score\": 5\n}"

It assesses how smoothly ideas are conveyed and how easily the text can be understood by the reader.\n\n# Ratings\n## [Fluency: 1] (Emergent Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response shows minimal command of the language. It contains pervasive grammatical errors, extremely limited vocabulary, and fragmented or incoherent sentences. The message is largely incomprehensible, making understanding very difficult.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** Free time I. Go park. Not fun. Alone.\n\n  **Response:** Like food pizza. Good cheese eat.\n\n## [Fluency: 2] (Basic Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response communicates simple ideas but has frequent grammatical errors and limited vocabulary. Sentences are short and may be improperly constructed, leading to partial understanding. Repetition and awkward phrasing are common.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** I like play soccer. I watch movie. It fun.\n\n  **Response:** My town small. Many people. We have market.\n\n## [Fluency: 3] (Competent Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response clearly conveys ideas with occasional grammatical errors. Vocabulary is adequate but not extensive. Sentences are generally correct but may lack complexity and variety. The text is coherent, and the message is easily understood with minimal effort.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** I'm planning to visit friends and maybe see a movie together.\n\n  **Response:** I try to eat healthy food and exercise regularly by jogging.\n\n## [Fluency: 4] (Proficient Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response is well-articulated with good control of grammar and a varied vocabulary. Sentences are complex and well-structured, demonstrating coherence and cohesion. Minor errors may occur but do not affect overall understanding. The text flows smoothly, and ideas are connected logically.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** My interest in mathematics and problem-solving inspired me to become an engineer, as I enjoy designing solutions that improve people's lives.\n\n  **Response:** Environmental conservation is crucial because it protects ecosystems, preserves biodiversity, and ensures natural resources are available for future generations.\n\n## [Fluency: 5] (Exceptional Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response demonstrates an exceptional command of language with sophisticated vocabulary and complex, varied sentence structures. It is coherent, cohesive, and engaging, with precise and nuanced expression. Grammar is flawless, and the text reflects a high level of eloquence and style.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** Globalization exerts a profound influence on cultural diversity by facilitating unprecedented cultural exchange while simultaneously risking the homogenization of distinct cultural identities, which can diminish the richness of global heritage.\n\n  **Response:** Technology revolutionizes modern education by providing interactive learning platforms, enabling personalized learning experiences, and connecting students worldwide, thereby transforming how knowledge is acquired and shared.\n\n\n# Data\nRESPONSE: Boston\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE based on the Definitions above. Your output should include the following information:\n- **ThoughtChain**: To improve the reasoning process, think step by step and include a step-by-step explanation of your thought process as you analyze the data based on the definitions. Keep it brief and start your ThoughtChain with \"Let's think step by step:\".\n- **Explanation**: a very short explanation of why you think the input Data should get that Score.\n- **Score**: based on your previous analysis, provide your Score. The Score you give MUST be a integer score (i.e., \"1\", \"2\"...) based on the levels of the definitions.\n\n\n## Please provide your answers between the tags: <S0>your chain of thoughts</S0>, <S1>your explanation</S1>, <S2>your Score</S2>.\n# Output"

A coherent answer directly addresses the question with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs, using appropriate transitions and a logical sequence of ideas.\n\n# Ratings\n## [Coherence: 1] (Incoherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response lacks coherence entirely. It consists of disjointed words or phrases that do not form complete or meaningful sentences. There is no logical connection to the question, making the response incomprehensible.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What are the benefits of renewable energy?\n  **Response:** Wind sun green jump apple silence over.\n\n  **Query:** Explain the process of photosynthesis.\n  **Response:** Plants light water flying blue music.\n\n## [Coherence: 2] (Poorly Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response shows minimal coherence with fragmented sentences and limited connection to the question. It contains some relevant keywords but lacks logical structure and clear relationships between ideas, making the overall message difficult to understand.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** How does vaccination work?\n  **Response:** Vaccines protect disease. Immune system fight. Health better.\n\n  **Query:** Describe how a bill becomes a law.\n  **Response:** Idea proposed. Congress discuss vote. President signs.\n\n## [Coherence: 3] (Partially Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response partially addresses the question with some relevant information but exhibits issues in the logical flow and organization of ideas. Connections between sentences may be unclear or abrupt, requiring the reader to infer the links. The response may lack smooth transitions and may present ideas out of order.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What causes earthquakes?\n  **Response:** Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates move suddenly. Energy builds up then releases. Ground shakes and can cause damage.\n\n  **Query:** Explain the importance of the water cycle.\n  **Response:** The water cycle moves water around Earth. Evaporation, then precipitation occurs. It supports life by distributing water.\n\n## [Coherence: 4] (Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is coherent and effectively addresses the question. Ideas are logically organized with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs. Appropriate transitions are used to guide the reader through the response, which flows smoothly and is easy to follow.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What is the water cycle and how does it work?\n  **Response:** The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth through processes like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water evaporates from bodies of water, forms clouds through condensation, and returns to the surface as precipitation. This cycle is essential for distributing water resources globally.\n\n  **Query:** Describe the role of mitochondria in cellular function.\n  **Response:** Mitochondria are organelles that produce energy for the cell. They convert nutrients into ATP through cellular respiration. This energy powers various cellular activities, making mitochondria vital for cell survival.\n\n## [Coherence: 5] (Highly Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is exceptionally coherent, demonstrating sophisticated organization and flow. Ideas are presented in a logical and seamless manner, with excellent use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices. The connections between concepts are clear and enhance the reader's understanding. The response thoroughly addresses the question with clarity and precision.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** Analyze the economic impacts of climate change on coastal cities.\n  **Response:** Climate change significantly affects the economies of coastal cities through rising sea levels, increased flooding, and more intense storms. These environmental changes can damage infrastructure, disrupt businesses, and lead to costly repairs. For instance, frequent flooding can hinder transportation and commerce, while the threat of severe weather may deter investment and tourism. Consequently, cities may face increased expenses for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts, straining municipal budgets and impacting economic growth.\n\n  **Query:** Discuss the significance of the Monroe Doctrine in shaping U.S. foreign policy.\n  **Response:** The Monroe Doctrine was a pivotal policy declared in 1823 that asserted U.S. opposition to European colonization in the Americas. By stating that any intervention by external powers in the Western Hemisphere would be viewed as a hostile act, it established the U.S. as a protector of the region. This doctrine shaped U.S. foreign policy by promoting isolation from European conflicts while justifying American influence and expansion in the hemisphere. Its long-term significance lies in its enduring influence on international relations and its role in defining the U.S. position in global affairs.\n\n\n# Data\nQUERY: Next, what shape has 4 sides\nRESPONSE: A square\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above. Your output should include the following information:\n- **ThoughtChain**: To improve the reasoning process, think step by step and include a step-by-step explanation of your thought process as you analyze the data based on the definitions. Keep it brief and start your ThoughtChain with \"Let's think step by step:\".\n- **Explanation**: a very short explanation of why you think the input Data should get that Score.\n- **Score**: based on your previous analysis, provide your Score. The Score you give MUST be a integer score (i.e., \"1\", \"2\"...) based on the levels of the definitions.\n\n\n## Please provide your answers between the tags: <S0>your chain of thoughts</S0>, <S1>your explanation</S1>, <S2>your Score</S2>.\n# Output"

There are a number of reasons for a high monocyte count, which can also be called monocytosis. Some of the reasons can include stress, viral fevers, inflammation and organ necrosis. A physician may order a monocyte blood count test to check for raised levels of monocytes. There are a number of reasons for this test, from a simple health check up to people suffering from heart attacks and leukemia. Complications with the blood and cancer are two other reasons that this test may be performed.\", \"Monocytes are considered the largest white blood cell. These cells are part of the innate immune system. Monocytes also play important roles in the immune function of the body.

No external knowledge is used to influence the ranking of the chunks; the system only relies on the provided context. Factual accuracy remains out of scope for evaluation.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** do game shows pay their contestants\n  **Context:** [\"So, in the end, game show winners get some of the money that TV advertisers pay to the networks, who pay the show producers, who then pay the game show winners. Just in the same way that the actors, and crew of a show get paid.

Meet the eligibility requirements. All game shows have certain eligibility requirements for their contestants. Generally, you must be at least 18 years of age, except for those shows that use child or teenage contestants, and you are allowed to appear on no more than 1 game show per year.\", \"Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: You don't always win the money amount on the front of your lectern when you are on a game show. As someone else said, 2nd place earns $2000 and 3rd place earns $1000 in Jeopardy! In any case, the prize money is paid out from the ad revenue that the show receives from sponsors. I think in this case Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Deal or No Deal is the best example of how shows can be successful while still paying the prize money. I feel this way because these shows have a potential, however small it may be, to pay out 1 million dollars to every contestant on the show. Here is the reality. Regardless of the show whether it be a game show or a drama, a network will receive money from commercial advertising based on the viewership. With this in mind a game show costs very little to actually air compared to a full production drama series, that's where the prize money comes from\"]\n\n## [Retrieval: 5] (Highly Relevant, Well Ranked, No Bias Introduced)\n**Definition:** The context chunks not only fully address the query, but also surface the most relevant chunks at the top of the list. The retrieval respects the internal context, avoids relying on any outside knowledge, and focuses solely on pulling the most useful content to the forefront, irrespective of the factual correctness of the information.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** The smallest blood vessels in your body, where gas exchange occurs are called\n  **Context:** [\"Gas exchange is the delivery of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream, and the elimination of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream to the lungs. It occurs in the lungs between the alveoli and a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries, which are located in the walls of the alveoli. The walls of the alveoli actually share a membrane with the capillaries in which oxygen and carbon dioxide move freely between the respiratory system and the bloodstream.\", \"Arterioles branch into capillaries, the smallest of all blood vessels. Capillaries are the sites of nutrient and waste exchange between the blood and body cells. Capillaries are microscopic vessels that join the arterial system with the venous system.\", \"Arterioles are the smallest arteries and regulate blood flow into capillary beds through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Capillaries are the smallest vessels and allow for exchange of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid. Continuous capillaries are most common and allow passage of fluids and small solutes. Fenestrated capillaries are more permeable to fluids and solutes than continuous capillaries.\", \"Tweet. The smallest blood vessels in the human body are capillaries. They are responsible for the absorption of oxygen into the blood stream and for removing the deoxygenated red blood cells for return to the heart and lungs for reoxygenation.\", \"2.

A coherent answer directly addresses the question with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs, using appropriate transitions and a logical sequence of ideas.\n\n# Ratings\n## [Coherence: 1] (Incoherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response lacks coherence entirely. It consists of disjointed words or phrases that do not form complete or meaningful sentences. There is no logical connection to the question, making the response incomprehensible.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What are the benefits of renewable energy?\n  **Response:** Wind sun green jump apple silence over.\n\n  **Query:** Explain the process of photosynthesis.\n  **Response:** Plants light water flying blue music.\n\n## [Coherence: 2] (Poorly Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response shows minimal coherence with fragmented sentences and limited connection to the question. It contains some relevant keywords but lacks logical structure and clear relationships between ideas, making the overall message difficult to understand.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** How does vaccination work?\n  **Response:** Vaccines protect disease. Immune system fight. Health better.\n\n  **Query:** Describe how a bill becomes a law.\n  **Response:** Idea proposed. Congress discuss vote. President signs.\n\n## [Coherence: 3] (Partially Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response partially addresses the question with some relevant information but exhibits issues in the logical flow and organization of ideas. Connections between sentences may be unclear or abrupt, requiring the reader to infer the links. The response may lack smooth transitions and may present ideas out of order.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What causes earthquakes?\n  **Response:** Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates move suddenly. Energy builds up then releases. Ground shakes and can cause damage.\n\n  **Query:** Explain the importance of the water cycle.\n  **Response:** The water cycle moves water around Earth. Evaporation, then precipitation occurs. It supports life by distributing water.\n\n## [Coherence: 4] (Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is coherent and effectively addresses the question. Ideas are logically organized with clear connections between sentences and paragraphs. Appropriate transitions are used to guide the reader through the response, which flows smoothly and is easy to follow.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** What is the water cycle and how does it work?\n  **Response:** The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth through processes like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water evaporates from bodies of water, forms clouds through condensation, and returns to the surface as precipitation. This cycle is essential for distributing water resources globally.\n\n  **Query:** Describe the role of mitochondria in cellular function.\n  **Response:** Mitochondria are organelles that produce energy for the cell. They convert nutrients into ATP through cellular respiration. This energy powers various cellular activities, making mitochondria vital for cell survival.\n\n## [Coherence: 5] (Highly Coherent Response)\n**Definition:** The response is exceptionally coherent, demonstrating sophisticated organization and flow. Ideas are presented in a logical and seamless manner, with excellent use of transitional phrases and cohesive devices. The connections between concepts are clear and enhance the reader's understanding. The response thoroughly addresses the question with clarity and precision.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Query:** Analyze the economic impacts of climate change on coastal cities.\n  **Response:** Climate change significantly affects the economies of coastal cities through rising sea levels, increased flooding, and more intense storms. These environmental changes can damage infrastructure, disrupt businesses, and lead to costly repairs. For instance, frequent flooding can hinder transportation and commerce, while the threat of severe weather may deter investment and tourism. Consequently, cities may face increased expenses for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts, straining municipal budgets and impacting economic growth.\n\n  **Query:** Discuss the significance of the Monroe Doctrine in shaping U.S. foreign policy.\n  **Response:** The Monroe Doctrine was a pivotal policy declared in 1823 that asserted U.S. opposition to European colonization in the Americas. By stating that any intervention by external powers in the Western Hemisphere would be viewed as a hostile act, it established the U.S. as a protector of the region. This doctrine shaped U.S. foreign policy by promoting isolation from European conflicts while justifying American influence and expansion in the hemisphere. Its long-term significance lies in its enduring influence on international relations and its role in defining the U.S. position in global affairs.\n\n\n# Data\nQUERY: Ok, what is the capital of Massachusetts\nRESPONSE: Boston\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

It assesses how smoothly ideas are conveyed and how easily the text can be understood by the reader.\n\n# Ratings\n## [Fluency: 1] (Emergent Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response shows minimal command of the language. It contains pervasive grammatical errors, extremely limited vocabulary, and fragmented or incoherent sentences. The message is largely incomprehensible, making understanding very difficult.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** Free time I. Go park. Not fun. Alone.\n\n  **Response:** Like food pizza. Good cheese eat.\n\n## [Fluency: 2] (Basic Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response communicates simple ideas but has frequent grammatical errors and limited vocabulary. Sentences are short and may be improperly constructed, leading to partial understanding. Repetition and awkward phrasing are common.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** I like play soccer. I watch movie. It fun.\n\n  **Response:** My town small. Many people. We have market.\n\n## [Fluency: 3] (Competent Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response clearly conveys ideas with occasional grammatical errors. Vocabulary is adequate but not extensive. Sentences are generally correct but may lack complexity and variety. The text is coherent, and the message is easily understood with minimal effort.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** I'm planning to visit friends and maybe see a movie together.\n\n  **Response:** I try to eat healthy food and exercise regularly by jogging.\n\n## [Fluency: 4] (Proficient Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response is well-articulated with good control of grammar and a varied vocabulary. Sentences are complex and well-structured, demonstrating coherence and cohesion. Minor errors may occur but do not affect overall understanding. The text flows smoothly, and ideas are connected logically.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** My interest in mathematics and problem-solving inspired me to become an engineer, as I enjoy designing solutions that improve people's lives.\n\n  **Response:** Environmental conservation is crucial because it protects ecosystems, preserves biodiversity, and ensures natural resources are available for future generations.\n\n## [Fluency: 5] (Exceptional Fluency)\n**Definition:** The response demonstrates an exceptional command of language with sophisticated vocabulary and complex, varied sentence structures. It is coherent, cohesive, and engaging, with precise and nuanced expression. Grammar is flawless, and the text reflects a high level of eloquence and style.\n\n**Examples:**\n  **Response:** Globalization exerts a profound influence on cultural diversity by facilitating unprecedented cultural exchange while simultaneously risking the homogenization of distinct cultural identities, which can diminish the richness of global heritage.\n\n  **Response:** Technology revolutionizes modern education by providing interactive learning platforms, enabling personalized learning experiences, and connecting students worldwide, thereby transforming how knowledge is acquired and shared.\n\n\n# Data\nRESPONSE: A square\n\n\n# Tasks\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the previous RESPONSE based on the Definitions above.

In any case, the prize money is paid out from the ad revenue that the show receives from sponsors. I think in this case Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Deal or No Deal is the best example of how shows can be successful while still paying the prize money. I feel this way because these shows have a potential, however small it may be, to pay out 1 million dollars to every contestant on the show. Here is the reality. Regardless of the show whether it be a game show or a drama, a network will receive money from commercial advertising based on the viewership.
