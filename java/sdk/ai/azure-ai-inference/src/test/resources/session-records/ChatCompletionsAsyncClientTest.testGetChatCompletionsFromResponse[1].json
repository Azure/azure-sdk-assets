However, in general, here are some tips based on typical weather patterns in Berlin:\n\n1. **Spring (March to May):**\n   - Layers are your friend! Mornings and evenings can be cool, while afternoons might be warmer.\n   - Light sweater or jacket, long-sleeved shirts, and an umbrella, just in case.\n\n2. **Summer (June to August):**\n   - Light and breathable clothing like t-shirts, shorts, and dresses.\n   - Don’t forget sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen.\n   - A light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings.\n\n3. **Autumn (September to November):**\n   - Layers again, as the weather can be quite variable.\n   - Lightweight sweaters, long pants, and a medium-weight jacket.\n   - An umbrella or raincoat for occasional rain.\n\n4. **Winter (December to February):**\n   - Warm clothing is essential: heavy coats, scarves, gloves, and hats.\n   - Layers of thermals or woolens under your main outfit.\n   - Waterproof boots if there’s snow or slush.\n\nPlease check today's weather forecast for Berlin to make the most informed choice! Do you have access to a weather forecast for today, or would you like me to look it up?",
