              "content": "To offer the best advice on what to wear in Berlin today, I need to know the current weather conditions. However, I can give you some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Check the Weather Forecast**: Look up the current weather forecast for Berlin. Websites like Weather.com or apps like AccuWeather can provide up-to-date information.\n\n2. **Layering**: Berlin weather can be quite variable, so layering is often a good strategy. This way, you can adjust your clothing to changing conditions throughout the day.\n\n3. **Seasonal Guidelines**:\n   - **Spring (March to May)**: Light jackets, sweaters, and jeans are usually appropriate. It can be chilly in the mornings and evenings.\n   - **Summer (June to August)**: Light clothing like T-shirts, shorts, and dresses are common. However, always carry a light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings.\n   - **Autumn (September to November)**: Layered clothing is ideal. A mix of sweaters, long-sleeve shirts, and a good jacket can help you adjust to the cooling temperatures.\n   - **Winter (December to February)**: Bundle up with heavy coats, scarves, hats, gloves, and thermal wear. Berlin winters can be quite cold with possible snow.\n\n4. **Footwear**: Comfortable walking shoes are essential, especially if you plan to explore the city.\n\n5. **Accessories**: Depending on the season, you may need sunscreen, sunglasses, an umbrella, or waterproof clothing.\n\nIf you tell me today's weather forecast or specific conditions, I can provide more tailored advice!",
