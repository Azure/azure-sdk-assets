Offer them a variety of toys, puzzles, and activities to keep their minds sharp and their beaks busy.\n\n6. Respect their limits: Remember, parrots be unique creatures with their own personalities. Respect their boundaries and don't force 'em to do anything they ain't comfortable with. Trust be a two-way street.\n\nRemember, me hearty, training a parrot be a journey that requires time, patience, and understanding. Enjoy the process and celebrate each small milestone along the way.
