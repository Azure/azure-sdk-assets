A detailed answer will describe laying the tortilla flat, placing filling at the bottom, folding up the bottom, tucking in the sides, and finally rolling everything securely. This will give a clear, helpful instruction for the user."

                "text": "Here's a step‐by‐step method often used by professional burrito makers to get a secure, neat wrap:\n\n1. Warm your tortilla. A warm tortilla is more pliable, which helps prevent tearing as you fold.\n\n2. Lay the tortilla flat. Place your tortilla on a clean surface with the center facing you. Some people warm it further (e.g., in a dry skillet) to enhance its flexibility.\n\n3. Add your filling strategically. Spoon in your ingredients (rice, beans, meat, vegetables, etc.) in a line across the center, leaving about 2 inches (5 cm) of space on each side and the bottom edge. Avoid overfilling; a compact filling is easier to roll without ingredients spilling out.\n\n4. Fold the bottom edge upward. Starting from the bottom, gently fold the tortilla upward over the filling. This creates a base layer that helps hold the other ingredients in place.\n\n5. Tuck in the sides. Next, with the bottom edge tucked, fold both left and right edges inward. This step secures the filling laterally and minimizes gaps.\n\n6. Roll upward tightly. With the edges securely folded, continue rolling the burrito away from you. Roll firmly and evenly to create tension. If your burrito feels a bit loose, ensure you tuck the sides again as you roll to maintain a compact shape.\n\n7. Finalize the roll. Once fully rolled, you can lightly press along the seam to seal the wrap. If desired, use a toothpick or wrap the burrito in parchment paper to hold its shape.\n\nEach step is crucial: warming the tortilla prevents breakage, strategic filling placement avoids spillage, and proper side tucks seal the burrito neatly. With practice, you'll develop a touch that yields a well-balanced burrito every time!"
