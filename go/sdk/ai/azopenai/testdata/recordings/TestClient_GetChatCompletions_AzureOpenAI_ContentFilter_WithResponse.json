              "content": "There are several ways to cook a bell pepper, depending on the dish you\u0027re making. Here are a few methods:\n\n1. Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400\u00B0F (200\u00B0C). Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n2. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and brush with olive oil. Place them on the grill, skin side down, and cook for 10-15 minutes until the skin is charred and the peppers are soft.\n\n3. Saut\u00E9ing: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Heat a pan over medium heat, add some olive oil. Add the peppers and saut\u00E9 for 5-7 minutes until they are soft and slightly caramelized.\n\n4. Steaming: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Place them in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water. Cover and steam for about 5 minutes until the peppers are tender.\n\n5. Stuffed: Preheat your oven to 350\u00B0F (175\u00B0C). Cut the tops off the peppers and remove the seeds. Fill with your choice of stuffing (like cooked rice, meat, vegetables, and cheese), place in a baking dish, cover with foil and bake for 30-40 minutes until the peppers are soft and the stuffing is heated through.\n\nRemember to always wash the peppers thoroughly before cooking.",
