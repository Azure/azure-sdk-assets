              "content": "To help you decide what to wear in Berlin today, I would need to know the current weather conditions. Here are some general tips for different weather scenarios:\n\n1. **Warm and Sunny**: If it's warm and sunny, lightweight and breathable clothing like a t-shirt and shorts or a summer dress would be comfortable. Donâ€™t forget sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen.\n\n2. **Mild and Pleasant**: For mild weather, consider layered clothing such as a light jacket or cardigan with a t-shirt and jeans or a casual dress. This way, you can adjust based on the temperature throughout the day.\n\n3. **Cool and Cloudy**: If it's cool, a sweater or long-sleeved shirt with a medium-weight jacket, along with jeans or pants, would be appropriate. You might also consider a scarf.\n\n4. **Cold**: For cold weather, you'll want to wear warm layers such as thermal wear, a thick sweater, and an insulated jacket. Don't forget gloves, a hat, and a scarf to cover exposed skin.\n\n5. **Rainy**: If rain is expected, bring a waterproof jacket or raincoat, and consider wearing water-resistant shoes or boots. An umbrella could also be useful.\n\nTo give you the most accurate advice, I recommend checking a reliable weather app or website for Berlin's current weather forecast.",
