              "content": "There are several ways to cook a bell pepper:\n\n1. Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400\u00B0F (200\u00B0C). Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until the skin is blistered and slightly blackened. \n\n2. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and brush them with olive oil. Place them on the grill skin side down and cook for 5-10 minutes until the skin is charred and the pepper is tender.\n\n3. Saut\u00E9ing: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Heat a pan over medium heat, add some oil and then add the peppers. Cook for 5-7 minutes until they are tender and slightly browned.\n\n4. Boiling: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the peppers and cook for 3-5 minutes until they are tender.\n\n5. Stuffed: Preheat your oven to 350\u00B0F (175\u00B0C). Cut the tops off the peppers and remove the seeds. Fill them with a stuffing of your choice (like cooked rice, meat, vegetables, cheese) and place them in a baking dish. Bake for 30-40 minutes until the peppers are tender and the stuffing is heated through.\n\nRemember to always wash the peppers thoroughly before cooking."
