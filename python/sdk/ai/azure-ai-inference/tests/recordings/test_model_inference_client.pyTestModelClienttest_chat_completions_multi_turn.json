This is another standard conversion in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement.\n\nTo go a step further, since there are 3 feet in a yard, you can easily convert between the two by either multiplying or dividing by 3. For example, to convert feet to yards, you would divide the number of feet by 3. To convert yards to feet, you would multiply the number of yards by 3.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
