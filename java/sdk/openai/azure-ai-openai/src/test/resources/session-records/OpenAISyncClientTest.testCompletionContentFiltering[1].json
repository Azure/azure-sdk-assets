            "text": " So we can just remove it. So 3 times 4 is 12. And also times 3. We\u0027re going to remove it. So 12 times 3 is 36. Okay? So this is 3 to the power of 4. So 3 to the power of 4 is 81. So if 3 to the power of 4 is 81, 3 to the power of 1 is obviously 3. Okay? So 3 times 81 over 3 times 3. Well, 3 times 81 is 243. 3 times 3 is 9. So 243 over 9. So you can always simplify that a bit further. 9 goes into 99 times. 9 goes into 36 four times. 4 times 27 is 108. And 9 goes into 108. Well, it\u0027s not 12, it\u0027s 12 times 9. So 12 times 9 is 108. So we can see that the answer is 27. Okay, question six. 1 over 16 plus 13 over 16 x, we just didn\u0027t give it, equals 1. So we\u0027re trying to find x basically. So we\u0027re going to move one over to the other side. You can think about it this way. You can think about changing the 16 into 16 over one. And if you convert these fractions into equivalent fractions so that they have the same denominator, it will be easier for you to add them together. So for example, here, 1 over 16. I need to multiply the bottom by 16. So I need to multiply the top by 16 as well. So I get 16 over 16. And then I just copy down the other part, x plus 13 over 16. And we know that this equals 1. So simplifying 16 and 16, and 1 and 16, that\u0027s just 1. So we\u0027re left with 16 equals x plus 13. And then from here, it should be quite straightforward if you subtract 13 from both sides, you get 3 equals x. Or you can think of it in another way. So I\u0027m going to change the question slightly. 1/4 plus something equals 3/4. So here, what do I need to add to 1/4 to make it equal to 3/4? We can see quite clearly it\u0027s going to be half. So the answer is half. So one way you can think of this question is, what do I need to add to 1/16 to make it equal to 1? It\u0027s easy to see that it\u0027s going to be 15/16 because of the way that one over a fraction shows you the fraction that you need to add to make it equal to 1. So if I have one section here and I want to have one whole, I need to add another 15 sections. Alright, so that\u0027s just an aside. Okay, question 7. 7/9 plus 1/3. So these two fractions are different. So we\u0027re going to have to find a common denominator. So we can\u0027t use 9 and 3 as they are. So if we know that 3 times 3 is 9, but we\u0027re already using the three here. So we have to find the next multiple of 3. So that would be 6 and I\u0027m going to try the three here. And we know that 3 times 3 is 9 and 3 times 2 is 6. Okay, so this is equal to 7 times 2. So we multiply the top by 2. The bottom part is unchanged and then we add, we have to do the same here. Okay, so 2 times 7 would be 14 plus 3. So 14 plus 3 is 17 and the denominator remains the same. So 27. And that\u0027s basically it. It can\u0027t be simplified anymore. Now, question eight, we have 55 over 64 minus six over 64. So the denominators are the same, the numerators are different. So it\u0027s quite straightforward. 55 minus six is 49 and that\u0027s over 64. So if we look at it, we could have also done 55 over 64 minus 6 over 64 times 64 over 64. So we\u0027re just changing the form of the six so that it becomes 64 over 64. Now, why 64 over 64? We know that anything divided by itself is just 1. So 6 divided by 6 is just 1. And if you think about the top, we\u0027re multiplying 6 by 64. So it\u0027s now 6 times 64 over 64. And that\u0027s going to be 384 over 64. And when you do the subtraction, you get the same answer, 49 over 64. OK? So either of those methods will work. Now, the last two questions are a bit trickier. OK? So 12x, so expression 1, divided by 5y, plus 11 over 10 equals expression 2. We need to make x the subject. OK? So I\u0027m going to actually cross multiply here. And the reason why is that when I have fractions that I need to add or subtract, I really need to make sure that they have a common denominator. But what I\u0027m actually going to do is because we only have two denominators, I\u0027m going to just look at the multiplication like this. 12x times 10 is 120x, and then 5y plus 11 times 12. So 5 times 12 is 60 plus 11 times 12 is 132. OK, now I\u0027m just going to make x the subject. So I\u0027m going to subtract the terms with x on both sides. So 120 x is equal to 5y plus 132 minus 11 over 10. OK, and that looks a bit messy, but if you have 10 as the denominator and then you look at 11 over 10, you can just make it easier for yourself and just add 10 over 10 to make it 132. Over 10, so you can see quite clearly we can simplify here. OK, so 120x is equal to 5y plus 143 over 10. And if you divide by 120, OK, you get 5y plus 143 over 10. Over 120. Now, we know that 10 goes into 120. Well, 120 is the same as 10 squared. So 10 goes into 10 once, and 10 goes into 120 12 times. OK, so we can see that we can simplify this. 10 goes into 5 half times, so we can write that as 5 over 2. And 10 goes into 143 14 times with 3 over 10. So this is the answer, 5y, plus 14 and 3 over 10. So what I did there was I divided by 120, and then simplified the fraction as much as I could. OK, finally question 10. So here we have square root 2x minus 9. So on the right-hand side, this is just a number. And the best way to deal with this is to get rid of the square root sign here. OK? So I have square root 2x minus 9 equals 5. OK? And what I\u0027m going to do is I\u0027m going to square both sides. So if I square both sides, I get 2x minus 9 equals, and then 5 squared is just 25. OK? Now, I\u0027m going to add 9 to both sides. The reason I\u0027m adding 9 to both sides is that I want to make x the subject afterwards, OK? So adding 9 to both sides, I get... I get 2x equals 34. OK? And dividing by 2, I get x equals 17. Alright, so that\u0027s the answer. But you have to check your answer in the original equation. OK? So we started with this equation, and we assume that x is 17. Does it work? So it\u0027s quite easy to check this. All we really need to do is substitute 17, which is x, into the original equation, which was square root 2x minus 9, and see if it equals 5. OK? Now, 2 times 17 is 34, minus 9 is 25. So we can see that this is square root 25. What is the square root of 25? It\u0027s 5. So yes, x equals 17 is correct. And that\u0027s it. OK, now that we come to the end of these difficult questions on secondary fractions, we hope you enjoyed them, and we\u0027ll see you again soon. Goodbye.",
