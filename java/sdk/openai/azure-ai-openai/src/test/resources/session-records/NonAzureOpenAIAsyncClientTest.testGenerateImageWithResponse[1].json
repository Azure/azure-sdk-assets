The general aesthetic should mimic Van Gogh's usage of bold colors, dramatic and expressive brushwork. The drawing should show the iconic structures of the city, with swirling, vibrant skies overhead, possibly embodying the feel of Starry Night. Aim for the signature look marked by short, energetic strokes of paint, and the dynamic, emotional feeling that Van Gogh infused into his pieces.",
