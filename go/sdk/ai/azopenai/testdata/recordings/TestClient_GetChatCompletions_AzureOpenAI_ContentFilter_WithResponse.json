              "content": "There are several ways to cook a bell pepper, depending on the recipe you\u0027re following. Here are a few methods:\n\n1. Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400\u00B0F (200\u00B0C). Cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until the skin is blistered and the peppers are tender.\n\n2. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cut the peppers into large flat pieces, remove the seeds and brush both sides with olive oil. Grill for 4-5 minutes on each side until the skin is charred and the peppers are tender.\n\n3. Saut\u00E9ing: Cut the peppers into strips or cubes, remove the seeds. Heat a pan over medium heat, add some olive oil and the peppers. Saut\u00E9 for 5-7 minutes until the peppers are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n4. Stuffed: Preheat your oven to 350\u00B0F (175\u00B0C). Cut the tops off the peppers and remove the seeds. Fill the peppers with your choice of stuffing (like cooked rice, meat, vegetables, and cheese), place them in a baking dish and bake for 30-40 minutes until the peppers are tender and the stuffing is heated through.\n\n5. Raw: Bell peppers can also be eaten raw in salads or as a crunchy snack. Just cut into strips or cubes and serve.\n\nRemember to always wash the peppers thoroughly before cooking."
