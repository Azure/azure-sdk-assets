Generally, you should consider the following:\n\n1. **Check the Weather Forecast:**\n   - Look up the current temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions.\n\n2. **Layered Clothing:**\n   - It's often a good idea to wear layers in Berlin, as the weather can be quite changeable. Layers allow you to adjust to different temperatures throughout the day.\n\n3. **Appropriate Footwear:**\n   - Comfortable walking shoes or boots, especially if you plan to explore the city.\n\n4. **Seasonal Advice:**\n   - **Spring (March to May):** Light jacket, sweaters, and possibly an umbrella. Temperatures can vary.\n   - **Summer (June to August):** Light, breathable clothing like t-shirts, shorts, and dresses. A light jacket for cooler evenings.\n   - **Fall (September to November):** Layers with a warm jacket or coat, scarves, and boots. Temperatures drop, especially in November.\n   - **Winter (December to February):** Heavy coat, gloves, scarves, hats, and warm boots. Berlin can be VERY cold during winter.\n\n5. **Weather Adjustments:**\n   - **Rainy Day:** Waterproof jacket, umbrella, and possibly waterproof shoes.\n   - **Sunny Day:** Sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen.\n\nPlease check a reliable weather source like a weather app or website for the most current information.",
