              "content": "1. Grilling: First, cut the bell pepper into quarters and get rid of the seeds and stems. Lightly coat them with olive oil and season, if desired. Next, place them on a preheated grill over medium heat. Cook them for about 10 to 12 minutes or until they are tender and slightly charred.\n\n2. Roasting: Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F (232 degrees C). Cut the bell pepper into halves or quarters and remove the seeds and stems. Place them on a baking sheet, skin side up, and roast them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until the skin is blistered and slightly blackened. You can place them in a plastic bag after roasting and leave them for a few minutes, the steam will help the skin peel off easily.\n\n3. Saut\u00E9ing: Start by cutting the bell pepper into thin slices or small chunks after removing the seeds and stem. Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add some oil. Once the oil is hot, you can add the bell pepper slices. Cook, stirring occasionally until they begin to soften. \n\n4. Stuffing: Preheat your oven to 375\u00B0F (190\u00B0C). Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Fill them with a mixture of cooked ground meat, rice, onions, and spices (or any stuffing you prefer). Pour some tomato sauce over the stuffed peppers. Place them in a baking dish and cover with aluminum foil. Bake for about 45 minutes. \n\nRemember to always wash and dry the bell peppers before starting any of the methods.",
